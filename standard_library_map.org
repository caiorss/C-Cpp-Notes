** Standard Library Headers

*C++ Standards* ([[https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/cp1_Basics.html][Source]])

 + *C++ is standardized as ISO/IEC 14882.* Currently, there are two
   versions:

   - _C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998)_ 1st standard version of C++.
   - _C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003)_ minor "bug-fix" to C++98 with no change
     to the language. Commonly refer to as C++98/C++03 or First C++
     standard.
   + _C++11 (ISO/IEC 14882:2011)_ 2nd standard version of C++.
   + _C++14 (ISO/IEC 14882:2014)_ 3rd standard version of C++.
   + _C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017)_ 4th standard version of C++.
   + _C++20 (ISO/IEC 14882:2020)_ 5th standard version of C++ (Under Development)

** Language Semantics and Fundamentals 

C++ Documentation related to C++ standard terminology and the C++
language semantics.

 *Type System* 

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type][Type System]]

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types][Fundamental Types]]

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference][Reference Types]]

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array][Array Types]]

 *Objects* 

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object][Object]] - Objects, polymorphic objects, strict aliasing and alignment. 

 *Value Categories*

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category][Value categories]] - Covers lvalues, rvalues, xvalues, prvalues and so on.

 *Generic Programming Fundamentals*

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req][Named Requirements]]  [VERY IMPORTANT, MUST READ]
   + "The named requirements listed on this page are the named
     requirements used in the normative text of the C++ standard to
     define the expectations of the standard library. Some of these
     requirements are being formalized in C++20 using the concepts
     language feature. Until then, the burden is on the programmer to
     ensure that library templates are instantiated with template
     arguments that satisfy these requirements. Failure to do so may
     result in very complex compiler diagnostics." 

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints][Constraints and concepts]]
   + "Class templates, function templates, and non-template functions
     (typically members of class templates) may be associated with a
     constraint, which specifies the requirements on template
     arguments, which can be used to select the most appropriate
     function overloads and template specializations. Named sets of
     such requirements are called concepts. Each concept is a
     predicate, evaluated at compile time, and becomes a part of the
     interface of a template where it is used as a constraint." 

 *Constructors*

   + "Gets alignment of the specified type. This struct is implemented
     in terms of alignof. Use alignof directly when you simply need to
     query an alignment value. Use alignment_of when you need an
     integral constant, for example when doing tag dispatch."

     and whether a bit field can straddle a storage-unit boundary
     Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which
     they are declared: the first member has the lowest memory address
     and the last member the highest."

** Memory access and Pointer arithmetic

 *Pointer Arithmetic* 

+ [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t][std::size_t]] - Integer which represents the size of a given type in
  bytes. Use cases: type size, number of items in a
  container/collection, array size, array index and so on.

+ [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer][std::uintptr_t]] (Header: [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdint][<cstdint>]]) - Unsigned integer capable of
  storing the address of a pointer regardless of the current
  platform. Note: The size in bytes of types int, long, unsigned long
  depends on the platform, so it is not safe to store a memory
  address in any of those types.

+ _std::intptr_t_ (Header: [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdint][<cstdint>]]) - Similar to std::uintptr_t,
  however it is a signed integer.

+ [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t][std::ptrdiff_t]] (Header: [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdint][<cstdint>]]) - Type-safe integer for pointer
  arithmetic, pointer offset and array index in a platform-indepedent
  way.

     expands to a static (until C++11) thread-local (since C++11)
     modifiable lvalue of type int. Several standard library functions
     indicate errors by writing positive integers to errno. Typically,
     the value of errno is set to one of the error codes, listed in
     <cerrno> as macro constants that begin with the letter E,
     followed by uppercase letters or digits. The value of errno is ​0​
     at program startup, and although library functions are allowed to
     write positive integers to errno whether or not an error

+ [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional][std::optional]] - A container which allows returning a value or
  returning nothing. It solves the problem of expressing that a
  function may return nothing in a more concise and type-safe way
  than usual approaches such as returning a null pointer, returning
  an empty object (null object pattern), throwing an exception or
  returning a tuple with boolean and a value. A common problem of the
  null pointer approach is that one may forget to check whether the
  value returned by the pointer is null. It may cause the
  null-dereference undefined behavior, which is similar to the null
  pointer exception problem that still haunts many languages like
  Java, C# and Python.

  + This type is similar to OCaml's Option,  Scala's Option and

** Generic Programming / Template Metaprogramming

 *Fundamentals*

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req][Named Requirements]]  [VERY IMPORTANT, MUST READ]
   + "The named requirements listed on this page are the named
     requirements used in the normative text of the C++ standard to
     define the expectations of the standard library. Some of these
     requirements are being formalized in C++20 using the concepts
     language feature. Until then, the burden is on the programmer to
     ensure that library templates are instantiated with template
     arguments that satisfy these requirements. Failure to do so may
     result in very complex compiler diagnostics." 

 + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints][Constraints and concepts]]
   + "Class templates, function templates, and non-template functions
     (typically members of class templates) may be associated with a
     constraint, which specifies the requirements on template
     arguments, which can be used to select the most appropriate
     function overloads and template specializations. Named sets of
     such requirements are called concepts. Each concept is a
     predicate, evaluated at compile time, and becomes a part of the
     interface of a template where it is used as a constraint." 


   *Useful Type Traits*


   + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_standard_layout][std::is_standard_layout]]
     + "If T is a standard layout type (that is, a scalar type, a
       standard-layout class, or an array of such type/class, possibly
       cv-qualified), provides the member constant value equal to
       true. For any other type, value is false. A standard-layout
       class is a class that satisfies StandardLayoutType." 

   + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_trivial][std::is_trivial]]
     + "If T is TrivialType (that is, a scalar type, a trivially
       copyable class with a trivial default constructor, or array of
       such type/class, possibly cv-qualified), provides the member
       constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is
       false. The behavior is undefined if
       std::remove_all_extents_t<T> is an incomplete type and not
       (possibly cv-qualified) void. The behavior of a program that
       adds specializations for is_trivial or is_trivial_v (since
       C++17) is undefined."

   + [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if][std::enable_if]] - Allows to restrict a function overload,
     alternative implementation of a function with different signature,
     based on a type predicate. For instance, it can be used to define a
     function overload which is selected only when the type predicate
     [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_integral][std::is_integral]] is evaluates to true (the type is any of int,
     long, short and so on.). Another overload, which only applies to
     float point types, can be defined by using the type predicate
     [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_floating_point][std::is_floating_point]].

    + "A short refresher on what Application Binary Interface (ABI)
      compatibility entails, a list of known proposals that have been
      dropped due to ABI compatibility concerns, and a summary of the
      critical issue: should we make C++23 an ABI break, or should we
      commit to ABI stability going forward? (This paper is similar to
      P1863 but provides much more introductory material and concrete
      suggestions.)"

  + N4028 - *Defining a Portable C++ ABI* - Herb Sutter 
    * <https://isocpp.org/files/papers/n4028.pdf>
    * Summary: Exlains the drawbacks of the lack of a C++ standard ABI
      and proposes a common ABI.
    * A C++ developer cannot compile C++ code and share the object
      file with other C++ developers on the same platform and know
      that the result will compile and link correctly. Our status quo
      is that two source files a.cpp and b.cpp can only be linked
      together if they are compiled with both: the same version of
      the same compiler, or another compiler with a compatibility
      mode; and compatible switch settings, since most C++ compilers
      offer incompatible switch settings where even compiling two
      files with the same version of the same compiler will not link
      successfully."

  + P1654R1 - *ABI breakage - summary of initial comments* - Roger Orr
    + <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1654r1.html>
    + "The Direction Group has been asked to look at ABI (Application
      Binary Interface) breakage. Note that this is different from,
      but related to, the API (Application Programming Interface). The
      first step was to solicit input from EWG/LEWG to try and capture
      the variety of issues covered by the single term "ABI

    + <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2137r0.html>
    + "This paper describes the goals and priorities which the authors
      believe make C++ an especially effective programming language
      for our use cases. That said, our experience, use cases, and
      needs are clearly not those of every user. We aren’t pushing to

      reification (i.e. conversion of a meta object to the base
