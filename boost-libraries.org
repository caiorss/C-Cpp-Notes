* Boost Libraries 
** Overview 

Boost Libraries are set of peer-reviewed and mostly header-only
libraries used by many projects and applications. They are regarded as
an extension of the C++ standard library and even many features from
the C++ standard come from Boost. Boost provides many facilities for
numerical computing; parsers; template metaprogramming;
network sockets TCP/IP and UDP; inter process communication; shared
memory and so on.

 * *Lessons Learned from Specifying Exception-Safety for the C++ Standard Library*
   * "This paper represents the knowledge accumulated in response to a
     real-world need: that the C++ Standard Template Library exhibit
     useful and well-defined interactions with exceptions, the
     error-handling mechanism built-in to the core C++ language. It
     explores the meaning of exception-safety, reveals surprising
     myths about exceptions and genericity, describes valuable tools
     for reasoning about program correctness, and outlines an
     automated testing procedure for verifying exception-safety." 
   * <https://www.boost.org/community/exception_safety.html>

 * *Generic Programming Techniques*
   * "This is an incomplete survey of some of the generic programming
     techniques used in the boost libraries." "
   * <https://www.boost.org/community/generic_programming.html>

 * *Counted Body Techniques*
   * "Reference counting techniques? Nothing new, you might
     think. Every good C++ text that takes you to an intermediate or
     advanced level will introduce the concept. It has been explored
     with such thoroughness in the past that you might be forgiven for
     thinking that everything that can be said has been said. Well,
     let's start from first principles and see if we can unearth
     something new...." 
   * <https://www.boost.org/community/counted_body.html>

 * *Boost Implementation Variations*
   * "The interface specifications for boost.org library components
     (as well as for quality software in general) are conceptually
     separate from implementations of those interfaces. This may not
     be obvious, particularly when a component is implemented entirely
     within a header, but this separation of interface and
     implementation is always assumed. From the perspective of those
     concerned with software design, portability, and standardization,
     the interface is what is important, while the implementation is
     just a detail." 
   * <https://www.boost.org/community/implementation_variations.html>

** Boost Libraries already in C++ ISO standard 

Some Boost libraries are redundant as they are already in the C++ ISO
standard. However, it is worth using them if a compiler to new
C++ standards is not available.

** Compiling a Boost project with CMake 

Some boost libraries are not header-only and requires linking against
a pre-compiled static or shared library. The compilation procedure can
be simplified with the CMake module [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBoost.html][FindBoost.]]

Some non header-only Boost libraries are:
 + date_time 
 + iostream 
 + filesystem
 + program_options
 + system (for Boost ASIO)

 *Sample project:*

File: CMakeLists.txt 
  + Note: It is assumed that Boost is already installed in the system.

** Compiling a Boost project with CMake and Conan 

Conan package manager allows a project use mutiple versions of Boost
libraries without prior manual installation that is time consuming as
the library has to be set up for a specific version and

** Boost Format 

The boost library format provides a type-safe printf-like notation
which is concise as the old C-printf functions (printf, sprintf,
fprintf) and less intrusive and verbose than the C++ (<<) insertion
operator. 

 + Documentation: [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/libs/format/doc/format.html][Boost format]]
 + Header: <boost/format.hpp>
 + Functions:
   + boost::str
   + boost::format

Using the library: 
 + As the library is a header-only library as almost all boost
   libraries. All what is needed to use it is just include the
   following header.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  #include <boost/format.hpp>
#+END_SRC

Example 1: Test in CERN's ROOT REPL.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  #include <iostream>
  #include <cmath>
  #include <boost/format.hpp>
  double x = 10.0;

  >> boost::format(" x = %1% ; sqrt(x) = %2% ; log2(x) = %3%") % x % std::sqrt(x) % std::log2(x)
  (boost::basic_format &) @0x7ffcfe86fbd8

  >> auto fmt = boost::format(" x = %1% ; sqrt(x) = %2% ; log2(x) = %3%") % x % std::sqrt(x) % std::log2(x);
  >> fmt
  (boost::basic_format<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > &) @0x7f8c7b52b020
  >>  

  >> std::cout << fmt << "\n";
   x = 10 ; sqrt(x) = 3.16228 ; log2(x) = 3.32193

  >> std::cout << boost::format(" x = %1% ; sqrt(x) = %2% ; log2(x) = %3%") % x % std::sqrt(x) % std::log2(x) << "\n";
   x = 10 ; sqrt(x) = 3.16228 ; log2(x) = 3.32193
  >> 
#+END_SRC

Example 2: Multiline code. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  // Pasting the following code block in the REPL between curly
  // brackets, including them.
  {
   std::cout << boost::format(" x = %1% ; sqrt(x) = %2% ; log2(x) = %3%") 
                % x % std::sqrt(x) % std::log2(x) << "\n";
  } 
  // Output:
  x = 10 ; sqrt(x) = 3.16228 ; log2(x) = 3.32193
#+END_SRC

Example 3.A: Turn format object into std::string.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  >> double z = M_PI_2;
  >> z
  (double) 1.5707963

  >> auto fm = boost::format("operation = %1% - z = %2% %1%(%2%) = %3%") % "sin" % z % std::sin(z) ;
  >> std::cout << "fm = " << fm << "\n";
  fm = operation = sin - z = 1.5708 sin(1.5708) = 1

  >> std::string result = fm.str();
  >> result
  (std::string &) "operation = sin - z = 1.5708 sin(1.5708) = 1"
#+END_SRC

Example 3.B: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
 >> std::string result2 = boost::str(boost::format("operation = %1% - z = %2% %1%(%2%) = %3%") % "sin" % z % std::sin(z))

 >> result2
 (std::string &) "operation = sin - z = 1.5708 sin(1.5708) = 1"
#+END_SRC
** Boost Lexical_cast 

Boost lexical cast is header-only library for converting from
built-int types to string and from string to built-in types. 

 + Documentation: [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/boost_lexical_cast.html#boost_lexical_cast.motivation][Boost Lexical Cast]] 
 + Header: <boost/format.hpp>
 + Functions:
   + boost::lexical_cast 

Example: 

 + *Headers and namespace:*

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  #include <boost/lexical_cast.hpp>

  // Namespace alias 
  namespace b = boost;
#+END_SRC

 *Basic conversions:*

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  >> b::lexical_cast<int>("456")
  (int) 456

  >> b::lexical_cast<double>(".4615e3")
  (double) 461.50000

  >> b::lexical_cast<double>("inf")
  (double) inf

  >> b::lexical_cast<long double>("34e5")
  (long double) 3400000.0L
  >> 

  >> b::lexical_cast<double>("inf error")
  Error in <TRint::HandleTermInput()>: 
  boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::bad_lexical_cast> > 
   caught: bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target

  >> b::lexical_cast<double>(" asdsas ")
  Error in <TRint::HandleTermInput()>: 
  boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::bad_lexical_cast> > 
  caught: bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target
    >> 

  >> b::lexical_cast<long double>(" 100 ")
  Error in <TRint::HandleTermInput()>: 
   boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::bad_lexical_cast> > 
   caught: bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target
  >> 
#+END_SRC

 *Catch exceptions:*

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  #include <cmath> 

  void PrintSquareRoot(const char* number_str){
       try {
          double x = boost::lexical_cast<double>(number_str);
          std::cout << "x = " << x
                    << " ; sqrt(x) = " << std::sqrt(x)
                    << "\n";
       } catch(boost::bad_lexical_cast const& ex)
       {
          std::cerr << " [ERROR] " << ex.what() << "\n";
       }
  }
#+END_SRC

Testing: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  >> PrintSquareRoot("34.34")
  x = 34.34 ; sqrt(x) = 5.86003

  >> PrintSquareRoot("-125.0")
  x = -125 ; sqrt(x) = -nan

  >> PrintSquareRoot("-12dsad 5.0")
   [ERROR] bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target

  >> PrintSquareRoot(" ")

  >> PrintSquareRoot(" 100 ")
   [ERROR] bad lexical cast: source type value could not be interpreted as target
  >> 
#+END_SRC

 *Function try_lexical_convert* 

Convert from string to built-in type without exceptions. 

Pseudo-signature: 
 + Returns true if succeed to convert source type to target type and
   then sets the result variable. Otherwise, the function returns
   false. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  namespace boost::conversion 
  {
    template<typename Target, typename Source>
    bool try_lexical_convert(Source const& arg, Targe& result);
  }
#+END_SRC

** Boost Operators 
*** Overview 

There are about 50 operators in C++ that can be overloaded which makes
implementing them repetitive and cumbersome. Boost operators is a
header-only library simplifies operator overloading by implementing
redundant operators in terms of each other. For instance, from the
operator less-than or (<), boost operators can automatically generate
the operators (<=), (>) and (>=). The library uses the CRT (Curious
Recurring Template Design Pattern) for generating the operators at
compile-time.

  };
#+END_SRC

The templated class *boost::less_than_comparable<T>* requires that the
client code implements the operator function less-than (<) or: 

#+CAPTION: Operator less-than (<) required by boost::less_than_comparable
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

  operator<(Vec3D const& lhs, Vec3D const& rhs)
  {
     return lhs.norm() < rhs.norm();
  }
#+END_SRC

From the operator less-than (<), the templated class implements the
following operator functions: 

#+CAPTION: Operators generated by boost::less_than_comparable

  friend bool operator<=(Vec3D const& lhs, Vec3D const& rhs);

#+END_SRC

The templated class *boost::addable<Vec3D, double>* requires the client
code supplying the operator (+=):

#+CAPTION: Operator function required by boost::addable<Vec3D, double>
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

      lhs = {lhs.m_x + d, lhs.m_y + d, lhs.m_z + d};
      return lhs;
  }

From the operator (+=), the class boost::addable generates the
operators:

** Boost Pointer Container 

The C++ Standard Template Library - STL does not work well with
polymorphic types as polymorphic objects cannot be stored in container
directly due to object slicing, only the base part is copied and the
derived is discarded; storing polymorphic objects with smart pointers
pointers is memory and exception safe. However, it is still cumbersome
and does not plays well with STL algorithms such as std::sort or
std::for_each with functors or lambda wrappers due to STL algorithms
be designed to work with values, not pointers.

The boost pointer container library provides STL-like containers for
holding heap-allocated objects or polymorphic objects. The containers
provide interoperability with STL algorithms; non-pointer notation for
accessing object members; single memory-ownership.  

Note: If there is shared ownership semantics, in other words, multiple
objects need to point to a polymorphic object during their entire
lifetime, then this library is not suitable to this use case. In this
situation, the best solution is to use a container of shared pointers
such as std::vector<std::shared<T>>.

** Boost Interprocess 
*** Overview  

[[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/interprocess.html][Boost.Interprocess]] is a library that provides wrappers or a common
interface for many operating-system-specific inter process
communication (IPC) primitive functions. The library provides wrappers
to the following IPC facilities:

 + File locking 
 + Mutex
 + Semaphore 
 + Shared Memory
 + Memory Mapped File
 + Message Queue 
*** Example: Shared memory facilities

Shared memory is the fastest IPC inter-process communication mechanism
available in most operating systems for exchanging data between
processes in the same machine. The share memory IPC allows data to be
shared by multiple processes without any copying overhead which makes
it faster than sockets, message passing and so on. However, using
operating systems shared memory APIs directly is not easy or
portable. Boost inter-process library provides many facilities that
encapsulates operating systems APIs with a higher level interface that
makes the code portable across many operating systems.

 + Documentation: [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/interprocess.html][Boost.InterProcess]]

This code provide many client/server examples about using the
Boost.Interprocess shared memory API and also about how to allocate
STL containers in a shared memory segment.

This sample program emulates a client that sends logging message to a
shared memory segment and a server that receives the logging messages
from the shared memory and prints them to the standard output
stdout. A named mutex object is used for coordinating both processes.

** Memory Mapped Files 
*** Overview 

Most operating systems have system-calls or APIs for mapping files
into a process' address space or virtual memory which allows reading
and writing to a file as it was a memory. Any changes in memory-mapped
file memory segment is immediately written to the disk. 

Among other things, memory-mapped files provide the following
benefits:

 * Faster and more performant file processing, specially for big files
   of Gigabyte-size (big-data).

 * Persistence and serialization:
   + Simplified serialization, any object allocated in a memory-mapped
     file segment is automatically written to the mapped file in a
     disk. And deserialization only requires reading the object from
     the memory or just casting a pointer without any special
     deserialization code.

Operating System APIs: 

 + Unix-like OSes or POSIX (Linux, MacOSX, Android, BSD, QNX ...)
   + Uses the system-call or API: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap][mmap]] for memory-mapped files.

 + Windows NT, Windows CE:
   + Uses the Win32 APIs: [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga][CreateFileMapping]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffile][MapViewOFile]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile][UnmapViewOfFile]]

The boost interprocess library provides a generalized interface to
those operating system specific memory-mapping file APIs. The library
also provides a C++ friendly notation, memory-allocators, memory
managers and so on that simplifies the usage on many different
operating systems.

*** Example - reading complex binary files 

Many complex binary files such as ELF (Unix object-code binary format), PE32
(Windows NT object-code binary format), JPEG images are defined by
C-structs which makes cumbersome and error-prone reading those types
of files with read/write functions. File memory mapping makes easier
to parse those complex binary files as it is not necessary to read
byte-by-byte, instead all it is needed is to cast file mapped address
to the binary format structs.

For instance, the ELF (Executable Linkable Format) header is defined
by the following C-struct. (Reference: [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html][Linux Manpage]])

Library Dependency:
 + Requires linkign the library *-lboost_date_time* with GCC or Clang.

Motivation: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The motivation for this library comes from working with and helping
  build several date-time libraries on several projects. Date-time
  libraries provide fundamental infrastructure for most development
  projects. However, most of them have limitations in their ability to
  calculate, format, convert, or perform some other functionality. For
  example, most libraries do not correctly handle leap seconds,
  provide concepts such as infinity, or provide the ability to use
  high resolution or network time sources. These libraries also tend
  to be rigid in their representation of dates and times. Thus
  customized policies for a project or subproject are not possible.
 #+END_QUOTE

Domain Concepts: 
 + Time Point
 + Time Duration
 + Time Interval 

Calendar Systems: 
 + Gregorian System
 + UTC - UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

*** Type: gsl::owner 

The type gsl::owner is proposed in the section [[https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-raw][I11]] of the core guidelines:

  + "I.11: Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer (T*) or reference (T&)" 

Definition: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  template <class T, class = std::enable_if_t<std::is_pointer<T>::value>>
  using owner = T;
#+END_SRC

The type _owner<T>_ is just an alias for a pointer type for annotating
raw owning pointer APIs that cannot be modified. This type allows
distinguishing raw owning pointers from non-owning pointers, making
the intent of the code clear. 

See: 
 + [[https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory.html][clang-tidy - cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory — Extra Clang Tools 10 documentation]]

Before: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   IBaseClass*  factoryFunction(int key)
   {
      if(key == VALUE1)
      { 
        return new Implementation1(arg1, arg2, ...);
      }
      if(key == VALUE1)
      { 
        return new Implementation2;
      }
      //  ... ... ... . 
      // Invalid input 
     return nullptr; 
   } 
#+END_SRC

After: 
  + The annotation gsl::owner<T> makes clear that pointer returned by
    factoryFunction owns memory and that it must release it later by
    calling the delete operator.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   #include <gls/pointer>

   gsl::owner<IBaseClass*>  
   factoryFunction(int key)
   {
      if(key == VALUE1)
      { 
        return new Implementation1(arg1, arg2, ...);
      }
      if(key == VALUE1)
      { 
        return new Implementation2;
      }
      //  ... ... ... . 
      // Invalid input 
     return nullptr; 
   } 

   //  --------- Usage: ------------------// 

   int main()
   { 
       std::cout << " Choose the implementation: ";
       int key; 
       std::cin >> key; 

      gsl::owner<IBaseClass*> object = factoryFunction(key); 
 
      object->InvokeVirtualMemberFunction();
      // ... ... ... ..

     delete object;
    }
#+END_SRC

*** Type: gsl::finally 

The gsl::finally can register a callable object (lambda, functor or
function pointer) which is called when it goes out of scope. This
function is useful for exception-safe resource disposal or cleanup.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp   
  {
     int* arr = new int [10]; 

     // RAII => Calls lambda when this object is out-of-scope 
     // and its destructor is called. 
     auto scope_guard = gsl::finally( [=]
                     { 
                        delete [] arr;
                        std::puts("Resource cleaned OK.");
                     });

     for(size_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) { /** set arrary */ }   
  } // scope_guard called here. 
#+END_SRC

*** Functions: narrow_cast and narrow

The functions narrow and narrow_cast are used in several sections of
the core guidelines, namely: 
  + ES.46: Avoid lossy (narrowing, truncating) arithmetic conversions
  + ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast
  + P.4: Ideally, a program should be statically type safe

 *Function: narrow_cast()*

 + The function narrow_cast is equivalent to a static_cast operator,
   but it makes the clear and evident that a narrow cast is being
   performed, a casting from type to another with _less bits_, therefore
   with possible loss of _information_, loss of precision or
   overflow/undeflow error.

Usage: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
  #include <gls/gls> // Include all heders

  double xx = 105e4;

  // Same as static_cast, but the intent is more clear.  Makes easier to
  // the reader spot that a loss of information or precision may happen.
  // 
  // Note: If an underflow/overflow happens in this case, it is
  // undefined behavihor. UB
  int nx = gsl::narrow_cast<int>(xx);
#+END_SRC

 *Function: narrow()* 

  + The function _narrow<T>()_ is similar to the _narrow_cast()_, but it
    calls std::terminate or throws an exception if there is a loss of
    information in the narrow cast.

  + The code in the next line throws a *gsl::narrowing_error* exception
    that abnormaly terminates the program because the value 10.535e10
    when casted to int, results in an overflow, there is not enough
    bits to store the entire integer part of this number. This runtime
    check makes easier to catch bugs like this. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   #include <gls/gls> // Include all heders

   double xx = 10.535e10;
   nx = gsl::narrow<int>(xx);
#+END_SRC
*** Type: gsl::span (C++20)

The GSL class *gsl::span<T>* (former gsl::array_view) is a _non-owning_
representation or a _view_ for a contiguous allocated sequence of
objects which can be a std::vector; std::array<T, size_t>;
zero-terminated C-string, a buffer represented by the tuple (pointer,
size) or (C-array, size). The gsl::span<T> view can also be used for
refactoring C-style functions that takes the tuple parameters
(pointer, size), representing a buffer, and making the function safe
against memory corruption, out-of-bound read/write and buffer
overflows, which can introduce security vulnerabilities.

C++20 std::span documentation (not gsl::span)

  + https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span

Motivating Paper: 

  + P0122R3 - span: bounds-safe views for sequences of objects
    + <http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2016/p0122r3.pdf>

Terminology: 

  + Non-owning: A gsl::span<T> object is not responsible for
    the allocating or releasing the objects that it points to.

  + View: Object that encapsulates a reference type or points to
    existing objects that it does not own.

  + Buffer: Any memory region represented by the pair (pointer, size),
    pointer to beginning of the region and buffer size.

Summary: 

  + gsl::span<T> can refer to any container: std::vector;
    std::array<T, size_t>; null-terminated character array; buffer,
    represented by pointer + tuple.

  + gsl::span<T> does not allocate any memory and copying it does not
    copy any element, gsl:span<T> is a _view_.

Use-cases for gsl::span<T>:

   + Provide range checking allowing to avoid buffer overrun (aka
     buffer overflow):  terminates the program abnormally by
     calling std::terminate or throwing an exception (fail-fast
     approach). The range checking can be disabled for   

   + Creating functions that can take std::vector, std::aray or a
     buffer which can be presented by a C-style aray or the pair
     (pointer, size). 

   + Refactoring: Make C-style functions that take a buffer parameter
     represented by the pair (pointer, size) safer against buffer
     overflow vulnerabilities. The view object gsl::span<T> has built-in
     array-bound checking, any out-of-bounds access can either throw
     a gsl::fail_fast exception or a call std::terminate terminating
     the program abnormally.

** Range v3 (C++20)

Ranges v3 is a header-only generic library that will be included in
the [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges][C++20 ranges]] and provides stl-like algorithms that can operate on
ranges, also known as pairs of iterators. The benefit of the range v3
library over STL algorithms and iterator pairs is that the greater
composability and that the calling code does not need to specify the
iterator pair explicitly.

** Printf replacements 
*** fmtlib (fmt) - Better printf 

Fmt is a highly popular library for printing in similar way to the old
C's printf. The advantage of fmt over old pritnf are the type safety
and concise format specifiers based on Python. 

 + The old C's printf is not type-safe and prone to security
   vulnerabilities if proper care is not taken.

** Serialization 
*** Cereal - Serialization library 

Cereal is a lightweight header-only library for serialization which
supports a wide variety of serialization formats such as binary, XML
and JSON. The library also provides lots of facilities for serializing
and deserializing STL containers.

 + License: BSD

 + Documentation and official web site:
   * https://uscilab.github.io/cereal

 + Github Repository:
   * https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal

 *Serialization Challenges*

Despite what it may look like, serialization is not easy, there are
lots of serialization pitfalls that a library shoudl deal with:

 + _Machine endianess_:
   + The order that bytes of numeric data are loaded into memory
     depends on the machine architecture, therefore a numeric data
     stored in a binary file generated in a machine with a *little
     endian* processor, may be read in a wrong way by a *big endian*
     machine. So, in order to be portable, a binary file must use a
     default endianess independent of the any processor.

 + _Data Sizes_:
   + C and C++ binary sizes of fundamental data types such
     as int, long and long long are not constant across different
     operating systems and machine architectures. So a value of long
     type save in binary format in one machine may be read in a wrong
     way in a machine where the long type has a different size in
     bytes. The only way to ensure that the data type is portable and
     avoid bad surprises is to use fixed width integers from header
     <stdint> uint32_t, uint64_t and so on.

 + _Data Versioning_
   + In order to avoid data corruption, a serialization format should
     support multiple versions of the data structure being
     serialized and check the version of the data whenever it is
     deserialized from any stream.

 *Supported Serialization Formats:*

 + XML
 + JSON
 + Binary

 *Headers:*

 * Serialization formats:
   - Binary Format:
     + <cereal/archives/binary.hpp>

   - Portable Binary Format:
     + <cereal/archives/portable_binary.hpp>

   - XML
     + <cereal/archives/xml.hpp>

   - JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
     + <cereal/archives/json.hpp>

 * Support for serializing STL containers
   + <cereal/types/vector.hpp> => STL Vector std::vector serialization

 * Support for polymorphic types serialization
   + <cereal/types/polymorphic.hpp>

*** Catch2 - Unit Testing Framework

Advatanges over other test frameworks:

 + Header-only library, so it requires no linking step or linking
   dependencies.

 + Uses C++ operators instead of many macros such as (X > 20) instead of
   EXPECT_GT(X, 20) (expect grater than) as in GTest (Google's test)

 + BDD - Behavior Driven Development

 + Property-based testing - testing with several random values and
   combination of random values.

 + Test with multiple data or data table which frees the user from
   writing lots boilerplate ASSERT_EQUAL(x, y). A single REQUIRE macro
   can be used for test a whole list of cartesian pairs such as (x, y,z, expected)

 + XML output in JUnit, xUnit format.

Problem:
 + Compile-time can be a bit slow due to the library be header-only.

*** Doctest - Unit Testing Framewok

Doctest is a unit test framework based on catch2 test framework,
however doctest has a much faster compile-time than many other
unit-test frameworks.

Advantages:
 + Easy of use
 + Faster compile-time
 + Easy to integrate, header-only-library
 + Operator based testing: CHECK(VALUE == EXPECTED), CHECK(x > 10)
   instead of No need to use macros ASSERT_EQ, ASSERT_NEQ (not equal)
   as in GTest.

Disadvantages:
 + No XML output with jUnit standard similar to GTest standard.
 + No integration with IDE
 + No data-driven test, aka parameterized test, or test with a list of value tuples.
