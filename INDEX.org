 * [[file:Understanding-CPP.org][Understanding C++]] (C++ in-depth)
   + Exploring C++ basic and advanced concepts and also modern C++
     features with both small and reproducible C++ sample programs and
     interactive examples taken from the CERN's ROOT/Cling REPL tool.

 * [[file:passing-lambda.org][Passing C++ Lambdas to C function-pointer callbacks]] 

 * [[file:standard_library_map.org][Standard Library Map]]
   * Hyperlinks to the C++ standard library and C++ ISO standard
     documentation categorized by common functionality. 

 * [[file:STL%20Iterators%20and%20Algorithms.org][STL Iterators and Algorithms]]

 * [[file:STL_Input_and_output.org][Standard Library IO - Input and Output]]

 * [[file:Libraries-and-featuresCPP17.org][C++17 new features and containers]]

 * [[file:CPP-template-metaprogramming.org][Template Metaprogramming]]
   + also known as generic programming.

 * [[file:Preprocessor_and_Macros.org][Preprocessor and macros]]  

 * [[file:math_and_numerical_computing.org][Math and numerical computing]]
 
 * [[file:multi-threading.org][Multithreading and concurrency]] 

 * [[file:cpp-design-patterns.org][Design Patterns]]
   + Object Oriented Design Patterns + Generic Programming Design
     Patterns + Functional Programming.

 * [[file:cpp-reference-card.org][General Programming Reference Card]]
** Libraries and frameworks

   + [[file:standard_library_map.org][Standard Library Map]]
     * Hyperlinks to the C++ standard library and C++ ISO standard
       documentation categorized by common functionality. 

   + [[file:boost-libraries.org][Boost Libraries / Boost Framework]]
     * Boost Libraries (note: Boost libraries are regarded as a
       complement of the C++ standard library and many of its
       components come from Boost libraries.)

   + [[file:cpp-libraries-review.org][C++ Libraries Review / Lightweight libraries]]

   + [[file:Libraries.org][C and C++ Libraries Bookmarks]]
     + Bookmarks of C++ libraries and frameworks for many domains,
       including: general C++ programming; system programming; embedded
       systems; physics, engineering and numerical computing.

   + [[file:embedded_scripting_languages.org][Embedded Scripting Languages]]
     + Survey of small and lightweight programming languages
       available as libraries that can be embedded in C++
       application for adding scripting capabilities. 

** C and C++ Tooling
*** Building Systems and package managers  

 + [[file:compiler-flags-options.org][Compiler flags and options]]
   + Reference card for C++ compiler options. GCC, Clang and
     MSVC(VC++) compilers.

 + [[file:building-system-cmake.org][Cmake Building System]]
   + Coverage of CMake building system. One of the most used building
     system and with the best cross-platform support.

 + [[file:building-systems.org][Other building systems]]
   + Coverage of C++ most used building systems such as GNU-Make and
     so on.

 + [[file:package-managers.org][Package Managers]]

*** General 

 + [[file:Tooling.org][Tooling]]
   + Compilation of several development tools for C and C++. 

 + [[file:Cpp-C-Debuggers.org][C and C++ Debuggers Notes]]
   * Notes about C and C++ debuggers. Covered: GDB (GNU Debugger) and
     WinDBG (Windows Debugger).

 + [[file:Doxygen-documentation.org][Doxygen - Documentation Generator]]
   * Doxygen documentation generator examples. 

 + [[file:Root-cern-repl.org][CERN's Root C++ REPL and CLING]]
   + Notes about the CERN's interactive interpereter based on
     Clang/LLVM for C++ where the user can type and evaluate C++ code,
     load libraries like shared libraries, boost libraries and and
     also test C++ with immediate feedback. ROOT is invaluable tool
     for learn, practicing C++ and create demonstrations.
** System Programming 

   + [[file:Linux-unix-system-programming.org][Linux and Unix system programming in C++]]
     + System programming on Unix-like operating system with focus on Linux.

   + [[file:WindowsAPI-cpp.org][Windows API Programming in C++]]
     * C++ system programming for Win32/Win64 API. Note: The Windows API
       is not part of the ISO C++ Standard and is exclusive to this
       operating system.

** Computer Graphics 

  + [[file:computer-graphics.org][Computer Graphics]]

** Miscellaneous 

   + [[file:cpp-alternatives.org][C++ Alternatives and mixed C++ development]]
     * Mixed C++ development strategies and alternative programming
       languages to C++ with the following capabilities: native code
       compilation; high performance; static typing and ability to call
       C-APIs.

   + [[file:DLL-Binary-Components-SharedLibraries.org][Shared Libraries - DLL - Binary Components in C++ / FFIs - Language Interoperability]]
     * Creating shared libraries, C-interfaces or C-APIs for C++
       functions and classes. A C-interface allows a C++ library to be
       consumed from C and many programming languages with
       foreign-function interface support such as Python (ctypes FFI),
       C# Pinvoke, Java (JNA) and so on.

   + [[file:CwrapperToQtLibrary.org][C Wrapper for C++ Libraries and Interoperability]]
     + Presents how to create C wrappers for calling C++ libraries
       from C and other programming languages via FFI - Foreign
       Function Interface. This note provides a sample C wrapper for QT-5
       Widgets GUI library that allows calling QT from C, Julia
       language and D language. The techniques used in this particular
       case can be reused for interoperability between many other C++
       libraries and programming languages.

   + [[file:Interfacing-C-APIs-and-libraries.org][Interfacing C APIs and libraries]]
     + Examples about how to interface and create wrappers to C APIs or
       libraries in modern C++ or C++ >= C++11 and use STL containers
       with C-APIs.

   + [[file:resources-executable.org][Embed Resources into Executables]] (Resource compilation)
     + About how to embed resources, assets, images, texts and binary
       files into executables.

   + [[file:sample-modern-cpp-programs.org][Sample programs in modern C++ style]]
     + Complete small C++ programs and proof-of-concepts.
** Bookmarks 

 + [[file:bookmarks.org][Bookmarks]]
   + Bookmarks, tools, online tools, conference videos and so on.

 + [[file:Videos-and-conferences.org][Videos and Conferences]]
