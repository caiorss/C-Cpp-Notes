* CMake Building System 
** Overview 

 *Motivation* 
 
  * _Easier cross-platform compilation and portability_
    + A single CMake building-script to rule all building systems.

  * _No reliance on a single IDE or building system_
    + CMake can generate projects and building scripts for many IDEs
      and also several IDEs are providing support for CMake without
      requiring generating a project to the IDE.

  * _Human-readable project file with a declarative language_
    + The project file is just a CMakeLists.txt human-readable text
      with a simple and declarative language, not an obfuscated or
      cryptic XML file, a verbose and fragile Json or a non-portable
      Makefile or Visual Studio Solutions.

  * _Easier to consume libraries and other projects_
    + CMake makes consuming external and internal dependencies easier
      than other building systems such as GNU autotools and GNU
      Makefile. All what it is needed to add a external library to a
      project is to copy the library directory to the project and add
      the line add_subdirectory(<LIBRARY_DIRECTORY>). Another
      advantage is that the library does not need to be installed
      in the system.

  * _All configuration managed by code rather than GUI and XML_
    + Almost all configuration of a CMake project are managed by CMake
      language code, rather than by GUIs graphical user interfaces
      like Visual Studio Projects with MSBUild. This approach allows
      more customization, scalability and also faster changes. Another
      benefits are the portability among IDEs with CMake support. This
      text-centric approach also frees users from learning IDE
      specific details or configuration GUIs. 

  * _Network effect (Network Externality)_
    + Network effect can be described as phenomenon where additional
      users increases the value of products and services to all
      users.
    + Many C++ libraries are being distributed with CMake; many open
      source projects are adopting CMake; most C++ package managers
      support CMake and IDEs are starting to provide CMake support.


 *CMake can be used in following ways:*

 + _Build a software directly from command line_ in a similar way to
   Unix's make - $ make and $ make install.

 + _Generate IDE-specific or preferred project files_ in IDEs that does
   not supports CMake, for instance cmake can generate projects from
   the file CMakeLists.txt for the IDEs and text editors: Microsoft
   Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, Kate projects, Sublime and Eclipse CDT.

 + _Manage a project in IDEs which supports CMake_. In this case, it is
   not necessary to generate IDE-specific project files.

 *Programming Languages supported by CMake* 

 + ASM - Assembly
 + C
 + C++
 + Fortran
 + CSharp C#
 + CUDA
 + CXX 
 + Java
 + RC - Windows Resource Compiler
 + Swift 

 *Capabilities:*

 + Generate IDE-specific project files.
 + Generate Visual Studio Solutions (projects)
 + Generate Makefiles (GNU Make) or NMake (Windows make) for direct
   compilation.
 + Run targets like GNU make
 + Build a software or library directly from command line.

 *Possibilities* 

A CMake project can contain one or more target (taks), similar to
Makefile rules:

 + Multiples targets for build executables - the same CMake file can
   be used to build multiple applications.

 + Target to build shared library

 + Target to build static library

 + Target to install aplications or libraries

 + Custom targets

 *CMake Project Examples*

  + [[https://github.com/caiorss/winapi-snippets-cmake][winapi snippets]]
    + Code snippets and examples for Windows API in modern C++ managed
      by CMake.
  + [[https://gist.github.com/caiorss/2bba4c50866d9467aaa8c7792b337f71][shared library]]
    + Example containibng: Cross platform shared library exporting
      functions, classes, polymorphic classes and C-interfaces
      (wrapper functions with C-linkage). It also contains a C++
      client-code and Python wrapper which uses Python ctype FFI
      foreign function interface.
  + [[https://github.com/caiorss/example-pybind11-vcpkg][example-pybind11-vcpkg]]
    + This example project contains a Python3 native module written in
      C++ with the help of CMake and Pybind11, vcpkg (C++) Package
      manager.

** Minimal CMake Project Workflow

This section contains a minimal CMake project that generates a single
executable which uses OpenGL libraries. All sources at: [[https://gist.github.com/caiorss/fd9e61887e9b2575f2275a80af44fac2][gist]]

A CMake project contains at least the file CMakeLists.txt (Cmake
building definitions akin to Makefile) and one or more sources -
files: *.c, *.cpp, *.cxx, *.hpp. 

Workflow:

 + Build and install the application or library directly from command
   line.

 + Generate IDE-specific building scripts if the IDE does not support
   opening CMake projects. Example: CMake can generate Makefiles for
   EClipse CDT or Visual Studio solution for old Visual Studio
   versions which doesn't support CMake.

 + Open and manage the project directly if the IDE or editor supports
   CMake. In Visual Studio, QTCreator or KDevelop, to open a CMake
   project, it is just necessary to open the directory containing the
   CMakeLists.txt. 

 *File:* CMakeLists.text 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)

  # Proeject name - should not contain whitespace 
  project(OpengGL_CPP)

  #========== Global Configurations =============#
  #----------------------------------------------#

  # Set the C++ standard for all targets (It sets the flags
  # (-std=c++11, -std=c++14 ...) on Clang or GCC. and /std=c++17 on MSVC
  # OPTIONAL:
  #---------------------------------
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)     
  set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

  #========== Targets Configurations ============#

  # Build an executable (Unix-like OSes generates ./openglDemo1, on
  # Windows ./opengDemo1.exe)
  # ..........................................
  add_executable(openglDemo1 opengl1.cpp)

  # Set executable dependency libraries
  # Equivalent to pass flags -lGL, -lGLU and -lglut 
  target_link_libraries(openglDemo1 GL GLU glut)

  # Add extension .bin to executable name to make it easier
  # to identify that the binary file is an executable.
  # So, it renames the executable  'openglDemo1' to 'openglDemo1.bin'
  if(UNIX)
    set_target_properties(openglDemo1 PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".bin")
  endif()

  # Add target to run executable 
  add_custom_target(run-ex1
      COMMAND openglDemo1 
      DEPENDS openglDemo1 
      WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_PROJECT_DIR}
  )
#+END_SRC

Without all the comments and the custom target, the CMakeLists.txt
file would become:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)
  project(OpengGL_CPP)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)     
  set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

  #========== Targets Configurations ============#
  add_executable(openglDemo1 opengl1.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(openglDemo1 GL GLU glut)

** Build a project from command line - detailed 

A project using Cmake as building system contains a build script at
top level directory named CMakeLists.txt. To build a project with
CMake, it is necessary to consider that CMake, is not a building
system and does not build anything. Actually, Cmake generates building
scripts for the platform preferred building scripts. For instance, on
Linux, it can generate Makefile, Eclipse Makefiles; on Windows it can
generate MSBuild scripts, NMake (Windows SDK's make) and so on.

 + Check all possible building system for which CMake can generate
   build scripts.
   + Command: $ *cmake -G*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
   # Running on Windows 10 
   $ cmake -G

#+END_SRC

 *Generate building script with debug symbols enabled:*

It automatically adds the debugging flags (/Zi) for VC++ Microsoft
Visual C++ Compiler which necessary for debugging a program with GDB,
LLDB or WinDBG. 

 + Add the flag *-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG*

** Sample Project with multiple targets 
*** Adding and setting multiple targets  

This section provides shows how to set up a project with additional
configuration and multiple targets which means a project with multiple
executables, shared libraries or static libraries.

 *Set up executable target*

 + Executable target defintion => Builds a *.exe on Windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake  
   add_executable(SampleApp main.cpp source1.cpp source2.cpp)
#+END_SRC

Header files can also be added to the target in order to make them
easier to access in an IDE such as Visual Studio. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake  
   add_executable( SampleApp 
                   main.cpp 
                   class1.cpp class2.hpp 
                   class1.cpp lcass2.hpp
                 )
#+END_SRC


 *Set target defines #define or -D<DEFINITION>=VALUE or /D<DEFINTION>=<VALUE>*

 + Compiler defintions. => Defines.
   + It is the same as compiling with GCC with command line option
     -D{DEFINITION}={VALUE} or compiling with MSVC VC++ with the
     command line option /D{DEFINITION}={VALUE} which becomes #define
     {DEFINITION} {VALUE} in the code.
   + Docs: [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_definitions.html][target_compile_definitions — CMake 3.13.2 Documentation]]

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
    target_compile_definitions(SampleApp PRIVATE  
       VERBOSITY=100  # Same as #define VERBOSITY 100 
       Optimize       # Same as -DOptimize or #define Optimize
       foo=bar        # Same as -Dfoo=bar on (GGCC or Clang) or /Dfoo=bar on MSVC
      )
   # In a single line 
    target_compile_definitions(SampleApp PRIVATE VERBOSITY=100 Optimize foo=bar)
#+END_SRC

 *Set target include directories*

 + Include directories containing header files. Similar to
   command line option -I with GCC.
   + [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_include_directories.html][target_include_directories — CMake 3.0.2 Documentation]]

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  # Similar to: g++ main.cpp src1.cpp ... -o app.bin -Isrc/include1 -I/home/user/include
  target_include_directories(SampleApp PUBLIC src/include1 /home/usr/include)
#+END_SRC

 *Set directories where shared or static libraries will be searched*

Set the directories where shared or static libraries will be
searched. Note: this command sets the search path for shared libraries
for all targets. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  link_directories(  
    # C:\Users\DummyUser\libs
    "C:\\Users\\DummyUser\\libs" # Windows paths with backward slash must be escaped with '\'
    "C:/libs/Graphics"           # Windows paths with forward slash 
    "/home/DummyUser/libs" 
  )
#+END_SRC

The command shown in the previous code is equivalent to compiling a
target with GCC as: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ g++ file1.cpp -c -o file1.o -LC:\Users\DummyUser\libs -LC:/libs/Graphics/ -L/home/DummyUser/libs
#+END_SRC


Shared Librarie files extensions: 
 + ~*.dll~ files on Windows for all compilers.
 + ~*.so~ files on Unix-like OSes
 + ~*.dylib~ or ~*.so~ on MacOSX

Static librarie file extension:
 + ~*.lib~ files for MSVC, VC++
 + ~*.a~ for GCC, GCC/Mingw or Clang++. 

 *Set linking libraries*

 + Libraries that the executable will link against.
   + It can be: shared libraries installed on the system or either
     shared or static libraries in the current project.
   + Note: Project libraries are also targets. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake  
   # Project shared library SampleSharedLib.so (Linux, Unix) or 
   # SampleSharedLib.dll on Windows. 
   add_library( SampleSharedLib SHARED  
                tools.cpp      tools.hpp 
                CShell.cpp     CShell.hpp 
                FileSystem.cpp FileSystem.hpp
              )
   # Configuration of target SampleSharedLib
   target_include_directories(SampleSharedLib PRIVATE src/lib/include1)

   # Project static library 
   add_library(StaticLibrary STATIC lib1.cpp lib2.cpp lib3.cpp)

   target_link_libraries(SampleApp  
           GL blas opencv ole32 user32  # System libraries  /usr/lib/*.so files on Linux 
                                        # or *.lib files for MSVC VC++/Windows compiler and DLLs 
                                        # at C:\Windows\System32
           SampleSharedLib              # Project shared library 
           StaticLibrary                # Project static library 
   )
#+END_SRC

 *Set compiler flags* 

 + Target compilar flags.
   + Note: The compilation flags are compiler-specific, the following
     flags only works for GCC and Clang, but they don't work for MSVC
     (VC++ Compiler) that uses forward slashes for compiler options
     instead of dashes. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   if(NOT MSVC) 
      # Only for GCC or Clang 
      # (g) => Add debugging symbols 
      target_compile_options(SampleApp -g -Wall -Wpendantic -Wextra )
   else()
      # MSVC (VC++) => "visual" C++
      target_compile_options(SampleApp /Zi /Wall /Yd)

 *Set target Properties*

  + Set target properties:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
 set_target_properties(SampleApp PROPERTIES 
     {PROPERTY1} {VALUE1}
     {PROPERTY2} {VALUE2}
     ... .... ... ... 
     {PROPERTYN} {VALUEN}
  )
#+END_SRC

Example 1: Add file extension .bin to Unix executable (note:
executables of Unix-like operating system do not have extension *.exe
like in Microsft Windows): 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
 if(UNIX)
    # When it is compiled, instead of generating the executable named as SampleApp, 
    # the program will be named as "SampleApp.bin". 
    set_target_properties(SampleApp PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".bin")
  endif()
#+END_SRC

Example 2: Modify multiple properties, set the shared library file
name to AddinExtesion.xll. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  add_library(WrapperLibrary SHARED src1.cpp src2.cpp ... srcN.cpp)
  # ... omit configuration ... # 

  set_target_properties(WrapperLibrary PROPERTIES
    # On Unix, it would add "lib" to beggining of the file name.
    # If prefix was not set to empty, the output file name would be
    # 'libAddinExtesion.xll'
    PREFIX       ""  

    # Change file name without changing prefix or extension (suffix)
    OUTPUT_NAME  "AddinExtension"

    # Change file extension 
    SUFFIX      ".xll"    
  
    # Makes all symbols hidden by default (compiles with by compiling
    # with flag -fvisibility=hidden on Unix-like Oses).  This setting
    # mimics the behavior of MSVC compiler extension
    # __declspec(dllexport)/__declspec(dllimport)
    CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden
  )
#+END_SRC

The target properties could also be set individually:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  add_library(WrapperLibrary SHARED src1.cpp src2.cpp ... srcN.cpp)
  # ... omit configuration ... # 
  set_target_properties(WrapperLibrary PROPERTIES PREFIX      "")
  set_target_properties(WrapperLibrary PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "AddinExtension")
  set_target_properties(WrapperLibrary PROPERTIES SUFFIX      ".xll")  
#+END_SRC

 *Add more targets* 

A CMake project can have multiple targets, generating executables,
static libraries or shared libraries.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  add_executable(DocGenerator src/docgen/main.cpp src/docgen/src2.cpp ...)
  # ... configuration of DocGenerator

  add_executable(Display src/docgen/main.cpp src/docge/src2.cpp ...)
  
  add_library(libCommon SHARED src/lib/src1.cpp src/lib/src2.cpp ...)

  # .... configure targes .... #
#+END_SRC

 *To avoid* 

 + *Commands which affects all targets*: for instance,
   include_directories(dir1 dir2 ...) will add those include
   directories to all targets regardless if they need them or not. It
   is better to use the command target_include_directories as it
   affects just a single target. The word 'should not' does not means
   'never'. If the intent is really set the same include directories
   for all targets, then the command include_directories should be
   used. 

 + *Non portable compiler settings.* Example: Compiler flags such as
   -D{KEY}=VALUE, used by GCC and Clang, or /D{KEY}=VALUE, used by
   MSVC (VC++) are non portable accross different compilers. To
   overcome this, CMake provides many commands with an unified
   interface to many compilers and build-systems, such as
   _target_compile_definitions_ that allows setting defines in a
   compiler agnostic manner.
*** Example 

Project directory structure:

 + ~C:\User\Dummy\Documents\SampleProject~  (Project Root Directory)

   * CMakeLists.txt

   * ./bin => Directory where the compiled binaries will be installed. 

   * ./src - Directory

  endif()
#+END_SRC


 *Compilation:*

Once the project file CMakeLists.txt is opened in any supported IDE or
an text editor such as QTCreator, the IDE will show all available
targets and provide menus, context menus or buttons where is possible
to select all targets for building the entire project; build individual
targets; debug an specific executable targets and run the *install*
target that copies the compiled files to the directory stored in the
variable *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX*. 

 *Running targets manually from command line without any IDE:* 

Step 1. Configuration - run the command from the project's top level directory.

 + Configure with install path CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set to default
   sytem location. (/usr/local on Linux). To install the binaries to
   the this location, set the variable INSTALL_LOCAL in the code to
   OFF. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  # Use Ninja build system 
  $ cmake -Bcache -H. -G Ninja 

  # Use Makefile 
  $ cmake -Bcache -H. -G Ninja 
#+END_SRC

 + Configure base install path (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) to
   /home/dummy/Documents/myapp, assuming that INSTALL_LOCAL is set to
   OFF.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ cmake -Bcache -H. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/dummy/Documents/myapp 
#+END_SRC

Step 2. Run targets. 

 + Run all targetes building the whole project 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
   $ cmake --build cache --target  
#+END_SRC

 + Run only the target SampleApp that builds the SampleApp executable:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ cmake --build cache --target SampleApp
#+END_SRC

 + Run only the target Executable2 that builds the Excutable2 executable 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
   $ cmake --build cache --target Executable2 
#+END_SRC
 
 + Run the target 'install' that will install all binaries specified
   in target install to ./bin directory if the option *INSTALL_LOCAL* is
   set in the code (ON). To install the standard location specified by
   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}, set *INSTALL_LOCAL* in the code to OFF.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
   $ cmake --build cache --target install 
#+END_SRC

** Sample Project with multiple sub-projects
*** Overview 

The following code is a cross-platform CMake project, with
sub-projects, containing 5 targets: a install target; a shared and
static libraries and two executables. The aim of this experiment is to
asses how a installation of a CMake project with multiple sub-projects
behaves on different operating systems.

     installing in this way are: different versions of the same

    install the applications to ~/bin~ directory which is a read-only file
    system.
  + Unlike other unix-like operating systems which installs everything
    scattered across the system (executables to /bin and libraries to
    /lib), in Mac-OSX, the most used approach for deploying
    applications is to distribute applications as _App bundles_, which are
    directories terminated in _.app_ suffix containing all executables,
    shared libraries dependencies (*.dylib), assets and metadata. The
    advantage of the app-bundle method of deployment are: applications
    are self-contained; they can be installed by just dragging and
    dropping them to the /Applications directory; they can be removed
    just by deleting a d single directory; different versions of the
    same application can be installed without disrupting each other or
    any other system library.

** Consuming or Dependencies 
*** Overview 

Note: 
 + object-code => Here means any compiled machine code, any file with
   the extensions: ~*.exe, *.o, *.obj, *.so, *.dylib~

CMake can consume libraries or external dependencies in many different ways: 

  * *Library Installation with building system* 
    + Installing the libraries with CMake, GNU Make, GNU autotools or
      any building systems and consuming them via find_package(LIB) and
      target_link_libraries( ....).
    + Disadvantages:
      * As C++ compilers do not have a standard and stable ABI -
        Application Binary Interface, the library needs to be
        installed for every different compiler and different version
        of the same compiler, otherwise it will not be possible to
        build an application that links against a library built with
        different compiler. 
      * Installing multiple versions of the same library may result in
        dependency hell breaking dynamic-linked applications depending
        on it.

  * *Library installation from operating system's package manager*
    + Installing libraries with a package manager such as Linux
      Fedora (dnf), Ubuntu (apt-get or Mac OSX (brew) and consuming
      them via find_package(LIB) and target_link_libraries(...).      
    + Disadvantages:
      * The installation is not reproducible in other platforms and
        often, it is not possible to install multiple versions of the
        same library and it may not be available in all package
        managers.

  * *CMake add_subdirectory(lib/<LIBRARY_DIR>)*
    + The library directory containing the source code is added to the
      project either via CMake [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html][ExternalProject]], manual copy or via git
      add submodule. The library is consumed in the project by adding
      a line: add_subdirectory(lib/<LIBRARY_DIR>) to the file
      CMaklists.txt. And the applications links against the library
      with target_link_libraries(app lib::libname).
    + Advantages:
      * No ABI issues as the library is built with the same compiler
        as the application.
      * Better for static linking.
      * More simple as it does not require the library maintainer to
        provide a CMake module for find_package.
      * Better reproducibility and easier compilation on different
        operating systems and also easier cross-compilation for
        embedded targets.
      * No dependency hell: As multiple versions of the library can be
        used in different projects without disrupting each other.
    + Disadvantages:
      * Longer compile-time
      * More disk space spending
      * The library is recompiled for every project.

  * *C++-specific Package Manager with CMake Integration*
    * Package managers automates the process of downloading libraries'
      source code and compiling them alongside the project. It is no
      possible to generalize C++ package managers as there are many differences
      among them. In the case of Conan package manager, it builds and
      installs the library object-code and header files to the Conan's
      cache directory where the library can be reused on many projects
      and recompiled on-demand if the compiler used to build the
      project is not ABI-compatible with the compiler used to build
      the libraries object codes.
    * Note: there are other package managers built as CMake scripts,
      but they fall short when dealing with libraries using other
      building systems such as GNU autotools or GNU Makefiles.
    * Advantages:
      * Automates the process of getting and installing libraries.
      * Saves disk space.
      * Shorter compile-time as library-object codes can be reused in
        other projects.
      * No ABI issues
      * No dependency hell 
      * Better for static linking and cross-compilation for embedded
        systems.
      * Reproducible on many different operating systems.
      * Makes easier to install big libraries, frameworks or libraries
        with many dependencies such as Boost and Poco libraries which
        depends on openssl which is problematic to build on Windows.
    * Disadvantages:
      * conan is not mainstream and there are still many competing
        package managers.
      * conan requires a Python installation, although it is not a big
        issue since there are many tools using Python as an embedded
        scripting language such GNU Debugger GDB or Windows Debugger.
*** CMake add_subdirectory

External libraries or sub-projects can be consumed with CMake command
add_subdirectory(<PATH-TO/LIB-DIRECTORY>) which builds the project and
the library source code <LIB-DIRECTORY> containing a
CMakeLists.txt. The benefits of this approach is that libraries are:

 * Libraries does not need to be installed in the system before
   usage.

 * No ABI incompatibility issue as the compiler used for building the
   application and library are the same. 

 * Better tracking of dependencies and no dependency hell as
   different versions of the same library can be used in many project
   without disrupting each other.

Drawbacks:

 + Higher disk space usage as every project needs a copy of the
   library sources.

 + Libraries need to use CMake as building system and contain a
   CMakeLists.txt file at root directory, otherwise, it will not be
   possible to use add_subdirectory command.

 + Possible complexity of git add submodule. 

 *Libraries used:*

   + [[https://github.com/gabime/spdlog][spdlog]]
   + [[https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest][cpputest]]

  *Creating project* 

(1) Create project and git repository 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ git init .
  Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/projects/cmake-experiment/.git/

  $ git add CMakeLists.txt main.cpp 

  $ git commit -m started
  [master (root-commit) 8e60c5c] started
   2 files changed, 16 insertions(+)
   create mode 100644 CMakeLists.txt
   create mode 100644 main.cpp
#+END_SRC

(2) Add external libraries to the project via git submodule or by
copying them manually.    

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ git submodule add  https://github.com/gabime/spdlog extern/spdlog
  $ git submodule add https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest extern/cpputest
#+END_SRC

(3) Show current directory: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ tree -L 2 .
  .
  ├── CMakeLists.txt
  ├── CMakeLists.txt.user
  ├── extern
  │   ├── cpputest
  │   └── spdlog
  └── main.cpp

  3 directories, 3 files
#+END_SRC


 *File: CMakeLists.txt*

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
   project(cmake-experiment)

   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
   set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

   add_subdirectory(extern/spdlog)
   add_subdirectory(extern/cpputest)

   add_executable(app main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(app spdlog::spdlog CppUTest)
#+END_SRC

 + The command [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html][add_subdirectory]] adds the sources of the library spdlog
   to the current build by processing the file
   extern/spdlog/CMakeLists.txt.

 + Libraries can be made easier to use and consume by listing in their
   documentation the _targets they define_ which client codes can link
   against with _add_library_. If the those targets are not mentioned
   the user has to inspect all libraries CMakeLists.txt files which
   can be cumbersome in libraries with many nested directories.  

Finding targets defined by spdlog and CppUtest libraries:

 + The file extern/spdlog/CMakeLists.txt contains the following lines
   that defines library targets which the top-level CMakeLists.txt
   file can consume:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  add_library(spdlog INTERFACE)
  add_library(spdlog::spdlog ALIAS spdlog)
#+END_SRC

 + The file extern/CppUtest/CMakeLists.txt contains the following
   lines which builds the extern/CppUtest/src/CppUtest/CMakeLists.txt
   as a sub-project.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  include_directories(${CppUTestRootDirectory}/include)
  add_subdirectory(src/CppUTest)
#+END_SRC

 + The file extern/CppUtest/src/CppUtest/CMakeLists.txt contains the
   following lines which defines the target CppUtest which the top
   level CMakeLists.txt that has add_subdirectory(extern/cpputest)
   can link against: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   add_library( CppUTest
               CommandLineArguments.cpp
               MemoryLeakWarningPlugin.cpp

*** FetchContent_makeAvailable (Approach 3) :opengl:glfw:graphics:

This example demonstrates how to use FetchContent for building an
OpenGL application that uses the GLFW library downloaded from github
releases URL. The commands FetchContent_Declare and
FetchContent_MakeAvaiable can be used with any other library as long
as it has CMakeLists.txt in its root directory.

Key CMake Commands Uses: 

  + FetchContent_MakeAvailable
  + FetchContent_Declare

*** CPM.cmake module [best]                           :cmake:best:dependency:

The CMake module CPM.cmake is a wrapper around CMake's FetchContent
which simplifies downloading libraries and dependencies
sub-projects. It can download libraries from GIT repositories, HTTP
servers and FTP servers. The downside of this dependency management
that it is only suitable for ligthweight libraries. 

This dependency approach is suitable not for large libraries or
frameworks with significant compile time, such as Boost libraries, QT
Framework or Poco libraries, as a downloaded library will have to be
recompiled for every new project. For this case, the best solution is
to use a package manage such as Conan or Vcpkg which can reuse binary
artifacts across many projects.

Official Repository: 
  + https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake

Examples: 
  + https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake/wiki/More-Snippets

 
  *Sample Project* 

In this sample project, the CMakeLists.txt automatically downloads and
installs CPM.cmake in the current project binary directory
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}. The module CPM.cmake provide the function
'CPMAddPackage' which is used for fetching the librares _spdlog_ and
_cppcodec_ from HTTP server and GIT repository.

*** Build executable for console or window subsystem 

The following CMakeLists.txt file defines two executables targets
built with the same source file main.cpp. The target
_app_console_subsystem.exe_ is compiled for the Windows' *console subsystem* and 
the target _app_window_subsystem.exe_ for the *window subsystem*. 

Applications compiled for the console subsystem opens a terminal when
clicked and prints the std::cout and std::cerr output to it while
applications built for the window subsystem do not open any terminal
and do not print any std::cout or std::cerr output. 

An window-subsystem application can perform logging by using the
Windows API function [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringw][OutputDebugString]], writing to a file or
redirecting the std::cout and std::cerr streams to file stream
object such as std::ofstream.

*** Export all shared library symbols 

CMake has a handy option _CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS_ that can
export all DLL shared library symbols without any
~__declspec(dllexport)~ or ~__declspec(dllimport)~ annotation.

 *Example:* 

File: main.cpp (executable main.exe)

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
   project(testbed_project)

   #=========== Global Settings ==============================#
   # ... omit other settings ... 
 
   # Export ALL DLLs symbols on Windows without __declspec(xxxx) annotations.
   set(CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS true)

   #=============== Targets-specific settings ====================#

   # Target: libutil (Library)
   add_library(utils SHARED utils.cpp utils.hpp)

   # Target: app1 => Executable (Dynamically linked)
   add_executable(main main1.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(main utils)
#+END_SRC

File: utils.hpp (Shared library utils.dll)

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   #ifndef _UTILS_HPP_
   #define _UTILS_HPP_

   #include <string>

   namespace  utils {

        class Dummy{
        private:
             std::string m_name = "<Untitled>";
        public:
            Dummy();
            Dummy(std::string const& name);
            void  showName() const;
        };
   }
   #endif 
#+END_SRC

File: utils.cpp (Shared library utils.dll)

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   #include <iostream> 
   #include "utils.hpp"

   namespace utils{
         Dummy::Dummy() { }
         Dummy::Dummy(std::string const& name): m_name(name) { }

         void Dummy::showName() const
         {
             std::cout << " [TRACE] Object name is : " << m_name << "\n";
         }
   }
#+END_SRC

Without the CMake option _CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS_, the class
Dummy would need the __declspec annotation and the code would be: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
     class __declspec(dllexport) Dummy{
     private:
          std::string m_name = "<Untitled>";
     public:
         Dummy();
         Dummy(std::string const& name);
         void  showName() const;
     };
#+END_SRC

To make a symbol private (visible only the _utils.cpp_ compilation-unit)
annotate it with the _static_ keyword or place the symbols in a
_anonymous namespace_, example:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   static void internal_function(int) {
     // ... code here ... 
   }

   static class InternalClass {
     // ... code here ... 
   }

   static struct MyStruct{
      double x; 
      double y;
   }; 

  // ---- OR make the symbols private with anonymous namespace  ------// 

  namespace {

     void internal_function(int) {
       // ... code here ... 
     }

     class InternalClass {
       // ... code here ... 
     }

     static struct MyStruct{
        double x; 
        double y;
     }; 

  }

** Snippets 
*** Place build-tree object-code in source directory 

The following sample project shows how to place build-tree
object-codes (executables and libraries) in the source directory
(project directory) for making easier to find them wihout browsing the
build tree. 

The sample project is comprised of two executables app1 and app2
linked against a shared library libutils.

*** Set common file extension for all executables

Unlike Windows, native executables files on Unix-like operating
systems don't have a file extension such as .exe which makes harder for
automation tools, such as Jenkins, distinguish them form other files. 

 + The following CMakeListst.txt builds two executables app1 and
   app2. The executable names on Windows are app1.exe and app2.exe. On
   Unix-like operating systems, their name become _app1.bin_ and
   _app2.bin_. Without the line with *CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX* their name
   on Unix-like operating systems would be _app1_ and _app2_.

*** Glob files from a directory or sub-directories

Globing allows adding files of a given cmake target without specifying
all of them explicitly. Although, it is not a good practice, it can be
useful for migrating projects using other building systems to CMake. 

Example: sample project that used GNU autotools or Makefiles. 

  + ./path/to/project <DIRECTORY>
    * CMakeLists.txt

    * main/   <DIR> =>> Executable Target: main -> ./main (Unix) or  main.exe (Windows)
      + main.cpp
      + class1.cpp
      + class1.hpp
      + class2.cpp
      + class2.hpp 

    * mylib  <DIR>  =>> Shared Library Target:  mylib1 libmylib1.so (Unix), libmylib1.dylib (OSX) or mylib1.dll (Windows)
      + class1A.cpp
      + class1A.hpp
      + class2A.cpp
      + class2A.hpp

  + The next lien sets the variable _mylib_headers_ to mylib a list of
    strings contains the file names: mylib/class1A.cpp
    mylib/class2A.cpp ... mylib/directory/file1A.cpp,

*** Copy some target binaries to a directory

This piece of code copies the target binaries (compiled code) to a
directory relative to project's root directory where is CMakeLists.txt 

Targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  # TARGET: testlib Shared library => Builds liblinalg.so on Unix or
  # linalg.dll on Windows.
  add_library(linalg SHARED  src/testlib.cpp)

  # TARGET: app Executable => Builds 'app' on Unix-like Oses and
  # unix.exe on Windows.
  add_executable(app src/main/main-app.cpp src/main/file1.cpp src/main/file2.cpp)
#+END_SRC

Copy target files to top level directory where is CMakeLists.txt 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  # If not set the install directory, attemp set the install directory
  # CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the directory ./bin 
  if(NOT DEFINED CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX OR CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX MATCHES "")

  # Copy targets to ./ - Directory where is this file CMakeLists.txt (project top level dir)
  install(TARGETS app linalg DESTINATION  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR})
#+END_SRC

This target can be run with: 

 + STEP 1: Set CMake building system or the project type with -G.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
 $ cd project-directory 

 #===> Set build system 
 # -H<SOURCE> -B<COMPILATION-OUTPUT> -G <BUILDING-SYSTEM>
 $ cmake -H. -G "Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild 
#+END_SRC
 
 + STEP 2: Run targets 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
 #===> Run all targets [all default.]
 $ cmake --build build --target all 

 #===> Run target install and copy the binaries to ./bin 
 $ cmake --build build --target install 
#+END_SRC

*** Create target to run compiled executable 

The piece following piece of code runs an executable target after it
is built in a similar way to a command $ make run. 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)

   ... ...  ... ...  ... ...

  # TARGET: myapplication 
  add_executable(myapplication src/main.cpp src/code1.cpp code2.cpp ...)

  # TARGET: run -> Runs the executable myapplication 
  # On Unix-like Oses, it runs  /<build-directory>/myapplication 
  # On Windows: it runs  <build-directory>/myapplication.exe 
  add_custom_target(run
      COMMAND myapplication
      DEPENDS myapplication
      WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_PROJECT_DIR}
  )
#+END_SRC

After the building system is set and output directory ./build, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
   #===> Run all targets [all default.]
   $ cmake --build build --target run
#+END_SRC

*** Issue an error if condition is not met 

In this piece of code, if the compiler is not MSVC (vc++, aka cl.exe),
CMake stops the generation of the building script showing an error
message to the user.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake

*** Debug Information for diagnosing problems

 *Set Build Type*

Informs whether the current build type is Release or Debug. Relase has
optmization flags enabled and debugging symbols disabled. Debug
building type has optmization flags and debugging symbols flags
disabled.

The build type is:

 + Release when :
   + $ cmake --build <BUILD-DIRECTORY> --config Release --target
   + $ cmake --build <BUILD-DIRECTORY> --config Release --target install

 + Debug when using (Default):
   + $ cmake --build <BUILD-DIRECTORY> --config Debug --target
   + $ cmake --build <BUILD-DIRECTORY> --config Debug --target Application1
   + $ cmake --build <BUILD-DIRECTORY> --config Debug --target install 

 *Set Installation Directory* 

The installation directory can be set with the option
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, examples: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  # Configuration 
  $ cmake -Bcache -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\Users\Dummy\apps 

  # Execute install target 
  $ cmake --build cache --config Debug --target install 
#+END_SRC

 *Useful Debugging Commands*

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake  
  message(" [INFO] Build type = ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}")
#+END_SRC

Target word size 32 bits (x86) or 64 bits (x86_64):

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
     message(" [INFO] Target = 64 bits build.")
  else()
     message(" [INFO] Target = 32 bits build.")
  endif()
#+END_SRC

Compiler: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  message(" [INFO] Compiler ID = ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}")
#+END_SRC

Current Platform: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  message(" [INFO] System Name = ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} ")
#+END_SRC

Binary directory <BUILD-DIRECTORY>

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  message(" [INFO] CMake binary dir = ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}")
#+END_SRC

Installation directory specifies the directory where the binaries will
be installed by the target *install*. It can be specified during
configuration phase by using:

 + *--DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Users\Dummy\app*

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  message(" [INFO] Install path CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} ")
#+END_SRC


Putting it all together:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   message(" [INFO]  System Name  - CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME     = ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}")
   message(" [INFO]  Build type   - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE      = ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}")
   message(" [INFO]  Compiler ID  - CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID = ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}")
   message(" [INFO]  Install path - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  = ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} ")
   if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
      message(" [INFO] Target = 64 bits build.")
   else()
      message(" [INFO] Target = 32 bits build.")
   endif()
   message(" [INFO] CMake binary dir = ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}")
#+END_SRC
** Force Settings 
*** Force generation of debugging symbols 

This snippet forces the generation of debugging symbols regardless of
the build type. It is a useful setting when building from command
line. 

Add the following line to the CMake file: 

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug) # Force debug build
#+END_SRC

After the line is added, the file CMakeLists.txt becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
  #========= Global Configuration ===============# 
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)
  project(Demo_cpp_plugin)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)     
  set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

  # Force debug build
  set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug) # Force debug build

  #========== Targets Configurations ============#

  add_executable(app ... )
  .. ... ... ... 
#+END_SRC
*** Force Compiler to Clang 

Despite C++ language remarkable improvements, C++ compiler error
messages of most compilers still cryptic and hard to grasp. Even for
silly syntax mistakes, C++ compilers can fill the screen with error
messages providing little context about the compiler error. 

Such cryptic errors can be better diagnosed by switching the compiler
to Clang that provides much better error messages that other compilers.
The compiler can be temporarily switched by using the IDE, by setting
environment variables or by setting CMake variables to force using an
specific compiler.


Example: CMakeLists.txt forcing compiler to Clang.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)
  project(NumericalMethods)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)     
  set(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)

  set(FORCE_CLANG ON)
  # Force compiler to Clang++
  if(FORCE_CLANG)
      set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
      set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)
  endif()

  #========== Targets Configurations ============#

  # TARGET: rootFinding1.cpp 
  add_executable(rootFinding1 rootFinding1.cpp)
#+END_SRC

 *Explanation:*

This next line sets the variable FORCE_CLANG:

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   set(FORCE_CLANG ON)   # Force using clang compiler 
   set(FORCE_CLANG OFF)  # Use default compiler 
#+END_SRC

When the variable FORCE_CLANG is set, the commands within the if-endif
block set the C and C++ compiler to Clang and Clang++.

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
  # Force compiler to Clang++
  if(FORCE_CLANG)
      set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
      set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)
  endif()
#+END_SRC

**** CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD - Set C++ Standard

 The variable ~CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD~ sets the project current C++
 standard. This variable can be set to 98 (for C++98); 11 (C++11); 14
 (C++14); 17 (C++17) and 20 (C++20 - experimental yet.)

  + Documentation: [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/CXX_STANDARD.html#prop_tgt:CXX_STANDARD][CXX_STANDARD — CMake 3.13.2 Documentation]] 

 Example: Set project to compile with C++11 ISO standard.

 #+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
 #+END_SRC

 Usage: (File CMAKELists.txt)

 #+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)
   project(MY_PROJECT_NAME)

   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
   ... ... .... .... 
 #+END_SRC

**** CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - Set default building type to DEBUG 

 In the debug building type optimization flags are disabled and flags
 for generating debugging symbols are enabled, for GGC or GCC/Mingw and
 Clang the (-g) is automatically added and for MSVC, aka VC++ (cl.exe),
 the flag /Zi is also passed to the compiler. The default building type
 can be set to DEBUG with the following code.

 #+BEGIN_SRC cmake 
   # Set default building type to debug if it was not set
   # in command line with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
   if(NOT DEFINED CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE OR CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE MATCHES "")
     set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  debug)
   endif()
 #+END_SRC

 The building type can be changed by running cmake with the flag
  (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release). Example: 

 #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
 #+END_SRC

 Note: CMake is not case sensitive, so it does not matter using
 'release' or RELEASE; if or IF; endif or ENDIF and so on. 

**** CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS - Compiler flags 

 The globals compiler flags used to build all targets can be extended
 by setting the variable CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS. However, as the compiler
 flags depends on the compiler, the custom settings may not be portable
 if one uses a different compiler, for instance the (-g) flag used to
 generate debug symbols with GCC or Clang does not work with MSVC
 (visual c++ compiler, vc++) as it uses the flag /Zi for generating
 debugging symbols.

 Example 1: 

 #+BEGIN_SRC cmake
   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}"  "-std=c++17 -g -Wall -Wextra -pendantic -O0" )
 #+END_SRC

 Example 2 (better):

 #+BEGIN_SRC cmake
   if(NOT MSVC)
      set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}"  "-std=c++17 -g -Wall -Wextra -pendantic -O0" )
   endif()
 #+END_SRC
