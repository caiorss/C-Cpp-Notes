* Embedded Scripting Languages 
** Overview 

Embedded scripting languages, sometimes called extension languages,
are programming languages available as self-contained software
libraries and designed to be embedded in a host programming language,
often a compiled statically typed language. Embedded scripting
languages allow adding new features, modifying the behavior of a
program at runtime without recompilation and source code
modification. Since embedded scripting languages are available as
libraries, the host language can inspect variables defined by a
scripting language program and call functions defined in the scripting
language for possibly allowing end-users to customize and configure
the application. Functions, also called subroutines or procedure, or
performance-intensive functions, that would not be suitable to
implement in a scripting language, registered by the host language can
also be called by the embedded scripting language.


Embedded scripting is useful for a wide range of user-case, including,
video games, interactivity, repl, configuration languages, sandboxing
and DSL - domain-specific programming languages. In video game
programming, languages such as Lua, Moonscript or GDScript (Godot game
engine) allow non-programmers such as game designers or game modders
to configure, extend and add new functionality to games written in C++
at runtime without any recompilation and dealing with low level
programming. These programming languages can also be useful for adding
interactivity, faster iteration cycle and feedback. An example of this
case is the beloved text editor Emacs that uses Elisp as its embedded
scripting language. End-users can inspect, modify and customize Emacs
behavior at runtime with instantaneous feedback by just evaluating
Elisp functions or modifying variables at the scratch buffer or Elisp
interactive REPL, the IELM repl. Another case where embedded scripting
can be found is web browsers, that are usually written in C++ and use
JavaScript, also known by the official name of ECMascript, and html
(non-turing complete) as its embedded scripting languages. Html
defines how the user interface look like and JavaScript modifies the
browser behavior and the html interface at runtime allowing curious
users to evaluate JavaScript, in the development tools console for
inspecting and interacting with html DOM (Domain Object Model) objects
with instantaneous feedback and synchronization between a modified DOM
element and its graphical representation.


 *Common API Functionalities*

Some common API functionalities of a embedded scripting language API
are evaluation of source code provided as string, file or input
stream; ability to register functions of the host language and call
them from the scripting language and possiblity insptecting variables
defined in the scripting language. Another common feature is the
ability to call functions defined in the scripting language from the
host language. The following code block provide some examples about
theses features.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
    
   Engine engine;

   // Ability to evaluate source code at runtime 
   value* result = engine.eval("10 * 3 - 5 / 100 * x3 + 2.51 * if(x > 0, 1/x, 0/0) ;")
   if( result == nullptr){
      printf("There was an error => shutdown the application.");
      exit(-1);
   } 
   
   printf(" [INFO] Result = %f ", result->to_float());
  
   // Interactive Python-like REPL 
   for(;;){
      std::string user_input = getline_from_console():
      if(user_input == "quit" || user_input == "exit"){ break; }
      result = engine.eval(line);
      assert ( result == nullptr );
      printf(" RESULT>> %s ", result->to_string().to_cstr());
   }
   
   // ----  Ability to register functions of the host language -------//

   value* udf_user_defined_function(size_t size, value* args) 
   {
        // .... ... do computations here... 
        return result; 
   }
    
   engine.add_function("user_defined_function, "&udf_user_defined_function);
   
   result = egine.eval(r"(
          x = 10.2512; 
          y = user_defined_function('hello', x);
          z = x + y;
          return z;
    )";

   // ------- Ability to call functions defined in the scripting language -------//

   engine.eval(" def myfunc(x, y) = 3 * x + 5.1 * y; ")

   FuncObject* = engine.getFunction("myfunc");
   assert FuncObject != nullptr;

   auto args = engine.make_args();
   args->add_int(10);
   args->add_float(20.0);
   result = FuncObject->call(args);

  *Reasonable Features of Embedded Scripting Languages*

This section lsits some reasonable features that a language designed
to be embedded should have:

   + _Ligthweight_ -  Small footprint, small size and memory requirements. 

   + _Scripting Engine as a library_:
     + Must be available as C or C++ library which exposes the
       interpreter API allowing the client code to evaluate scripting
       code from strings or files and also to retrieve objects from the
       virtual machine memory.

   + _Sandboxing or capability limitations_
     + A reasonable requirement for an embedded scripting language is
       limiting the capabilities and APIs which can be used possibly
       allowing the execution of non-trusted scripts. Example: the
       Javascript engines of most web browsers do not allow the script
       to interact with file systems or operating system APIs.

   + _Permissive License for static linking_ 

   + _Use Cases_
     + DSL - Domain Specific Languages 
     + Game Engines 
     + Configuration files => Data Description language. 
     + User content
     + Allow application runtime changes without recompilation.
     + User extension without modification of source code. 

 *Examples of embedded scripting languages usage and use-cases*

     * TCL - Tool Command Language => Used by many EDA - Electronic
       Design Automation Sofware in electronic engineering.

     * JavaScript => Used in Web Browsers, which are written mostly in
       C++, for controlling user interaction, animation and etc. 

     * TinyScheme => Used by GNU GIMP drawing application ans Apple's
       MacOSX sandbox configuration. 

     * Lua language => Used by many game engines and also by
       applications such as: Nginx web server; Linux Conky; Geany
       Editor; NMap editor and so on.

     * Squirrel Language => Used in game engines

     * Python
       + => Python is used as embedded scripting language by GDB - GNU
         Debugger ; WinDBG  - Windows Debugger; IDA - Debugger for
         Reverse Engineering.
       + Disadvantages: Python has a large footprint; it was not
         designed as an embedded scripting language and it is not
         possible to forbid the interpreter from calling file system
         and process creation APIs.

     * AutoLisp [proprietary] => Lisp-like language used in Autocad.

     * SQL (Structured Query Language) => Many databases are
       implemented in C or C++ uses SQL as scripting language and
       domain specific language (DSL) for querying and storing
       data. Example: SQLite, Postgres SQL, ...

     * Emacs Lisp => Emacs core, including the LISP
       engine/interpreter, is written in C and other parts are
       written in Emacs Lisp. This lisp dialect allows extending Emacs
       at with custom extensions (plugins) and also modifying the
       application behavior at runtime.

     * VBA - Visual Basic for Application [proprietary] => Used in
       Microsft Office Suite, specially in Microsft Excel.

 *Considerations for choosing embedded scripting languages*

  * Small footprint and small overhead

  * Stability of C or C++ API 

  * C++ API bindings

  * Permissive license for static linking or option of dual license
    for static linking. 

  * Documentation and of C or C++ binding APIs, examples about binding
    code

  * Garbage collector implementation 

  * Heavy duty computations with significant overhead should be
    performed on the C++-side, specially loops.

  * JIT - Just-In-Time compiler => can increase the performance by
    translating bytecodes into machine code.
    + Example: Lua JIT, Javascript V8 engine used by Chrome browser.

  * Features for running untrusted scripts or configuration: 

    * Ability for restricting capabilities such as creating process,
      accessing the file system and so on.

    * Non-turing complete => better for configuration 

  * Familiarity of the targe audience

    * Lua is pervasive in Games

    * TCL is pervasive on Electronic Design Automation Software 

    * Javascript is widely used on the Web, NodeJS and also as
      embedded scripting language of web browsers.

** Exprtk - Math expression parser 

Exprtk is a MIT-license single-header, header-only and turing-complete
math expression parsing engine.

Official Web Site: 

  + http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/

Official repository: 

  + https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk/

Features: 

   * Header-only library in  a single file.
   * Turing-complete
   * Sandboxed
   * Supports binding to defined-functions in C++-side.
   * Functions can operate on vectors
   * Control structures: for-loop; if-else; ternary operator.

Drawbacks: 

  + The library exprtk.hpp has one megabyte (1 mb) in a single header
    file which significantly slows down the compile-time. Header-only
    design should only be used for small libraries.


  *Sample Project* 

   + GIST: https://gist.github.com/2ff870b653b2ec1519bf0423165db1c5

   + Note: The static library target 'mparser' makes the compile-time
     of the client code 'main.cpp' faster by using the PIMPL
     (Pointer-To-Implementation) design pattern and not exposing
     exprtk.hpp in the library header file.

** Lua scripting engine 
*** Overview 

Lua (moon in Portuguese) is a ligthweight multi paradigm scripting
language written in C. Due to Lua be available as small footprint
library, this language is widely used as embedded scripting by many
applications for scripting and as configuration or data description
language.

Use cases: 

  + Scripting for C or C++ applications

  + Extension language => Add new functionality and updates without
    recompilation. 

  + Provide interactive REPL or shell to C or C++ applications.

  + Program configuration (settings)

  + Data description language 

Some applications using Lua: 

  + [[https://nmap.org/book/nse-language.html][Nmap]] network scanner 
  + MediaWiki (engine used by Wikipedia)
  + Nginx Web Server
  + Redis Database 
  + Linux Conky 
  + LuaTex
  + NetBSD
  + Cheat Engine
  + Geany text editor
  + [[https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake][Xmake]] building system for C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Assembly,
    Golang, Rust, Dlang and Cuda
  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games][Lots of games]] use lua for scripting and allow non-programmers,
    such as end-users and game artists to contribute to the game
    development, create animations, movements, finite state machines
    and so on.

      _extensibility. It offers a powerful and well-documented API for_
      interfacing with other software such as Nmap. The second part of
      _the Nmap Scripting Engine is the NSE Library, which connects Lua_
      _and Nmap_. This layer handles issues such as initialization of
      the Lua interpreter, scheduling of parallel script execution,
      script retrieval and more. It is also the heart of the NSE
      network I/O framework and the exception handling mechanism. It
      also includes utility libraries to make scripts more powerful
      and convenient. The utility library modules and extensions are
      described in the section called 'NSE Libraries'."

    + "C++ is a great tool for solving complex problems in a thorough
      way. But every once in a while, the desire for a simpler
      language emerges. For those parts of our code where performance
      is of secondary concern, but the ability to perform rapid
      iterations over the code is paramount, a scripting language
      might be a tempting choice. But integrating a second language
      besides C++ and managing the interaction between the two is also
      scary. Lua is a lightweight, dynamic language that was designed
      to be used as an embedded language within existing
      applications. It is easy to learn, has very reasonable runtime
      performance, and a memory footprint small enough that it is
      usable even on embedded systems. Furthermore, it is almost
      trivial to integrate with C++. This talk will give a brief
      introduction to the Lua scripting language, highlighting
      specifically how it can complement C++'s language features to
      enrich a developer's toolbox. In the second part of the talk, we
      will look at Lua's C API and give suggestions how to integrate
      it with a modern C++17 codebase. In particular we will focus on
      how to interface with the dynamic language Lua without
      compromising the benefits of C++'s strong type system."

    + "A big part of accelerating development and promoting
      collaboration often translates to deferring a lot of the typical
      programmer work to a scripting language, to allow for those with
      more design-oriented ideas and experience to handle some of the
      workload. What happens, then, when you have to bind a scripting
      language like Lua into C++ to allow for this workflow? This
      session is going to be all about how you enable non-developers
      and developers alike to rapidly increase their development
      productivity by turning routines and algorithms into data that
      can be shipped alongside your product in Lua. We will talk
      primarily how you can use the library sol2 to abstract away the
      muck of working with the Lua C API and instead focus on using
      and describing both Lua and C++ with each other in a simple
      manner. We will demonstrate some of the more interesting
      properties of sol such as Overloading Support, Container
      Support, Usertypes -- C++ classes made available with automatic
      support for unique/shared pointers -- and Tables. By the time
      this session is over, you will have a firm grasp over what a
      good Lua Binding can offer you, and how you can accelerate your
      C++ development with it."

*** Example project with Sol2 C++ binding library 

This sample project builds a C++ statically linked executable
embedding the Lua scripting engine using the Sol2 binding library,
which is header only. Neither Sol2 nor Lua libraries need to be
installed before building this sample project as the CMake scripts
take care of downloading and building all dependencies.

** Squirrel Scripting Language 
*** Overview 

   + Squirrel is a embedded scripting language, similar to Lua, but with
     C-like syntax, designed to be embedded in larger C or C++
     applications such as game engines. Squirrel is written in C++, but
     it only exposes a C API, which makes binding C++ code
     cumbersome. However, there are many libraries which simplifies the
     embedding of squirrel in C++ codebases.

*** Example - embedding Squirrel with Squall Library 

This example demonstrates how to embed the Squirrel programming
language in a C++ application using the Squall header-only library. 

   + Squal Repository: https://github.com/jonigata/squall

   + Note: This project is self-contained, no library needs to be
     installed on the system as Squall automatically fetches Squirrel
     sources using Cmake FetchContent.

** Duktape - Embeddable Javascript Engine 
*** Overview 

  + Duktape is a small footprint embeddable Javascript (ECMAScript)
    engine, written in C, which can be used for providing scripting
    capabilities for C or C++ applications.

  + License: MIT

  + Possible Use Cases:
    + Configuration
    + Data description language
    + User plugins
    + User extensions
    + Scripting for games 

  + Features:
    + Embeddable, portable, compact: can run on platforms with 160kB
      flash and 64kB RAM 
    + Built-in debugger
    + Built-in regular expression engine
    + Minimal, retargetable platform dependencies
    + Combined reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage
      collection with finalization 
    + Bytecode dump/load for caching compiled functions
    + Distributable includes an optional logging framework,
      CommonJS-based module loading implementations, etc

   + https://github.com/stfwi/duktape-cc
*** Example project with DukGlue C++ binding library 

This following project CMakeLists.txt automatically downloads _dukglue_
binding library and _duktape_ engine sources and builds a C++ demonstration
code embedding duktape JavaScript engine. 

  + DukGlue Binding Library: https://github.com/Aloshi/dukglue
    + Advantage:
      * Easy to use and lots of examples. 
    + Drawbacks:
      * Lack of namespaces which enhances API discoverability
      * Lack of C++ wrappers to some Duktape C-types
      * Lack of a CMakeLists.txt at the top directory.

*** Example project with Duktape-CC binding library 

  + Duktape-CC binding library: https://github.com/stfwi/duktape-cc/
    + Benefits 
      + Namespace 
      + RAII for duktape C-API
      + Javascript common known APIs such as console.log()

      + No CMakeLists.txt at top directory, which makes the library

** QuickJS - ES20 Javascript Engine 

QuickJS is small and lightweight embeddable Javascript engine, written
in C, which supports ES2020 technical specification. This engine was
created by Fabrice Bellard, creator of many widely used open source
projects, namely, QEMU emulator used for emulation of operating
systems and embedded systems hardware; FFmpeg tool for video and audio
conversion; TCC (Tiny C Compiler). Some features supported by the
engine are: modules, proxies, BigInt and asynchronous generators.

  *Sample CMake project* 

The following sample CMake projects demonstrates how to embed QuickJS
engine in a C++ code by using the QuickJSpp C++ wrapper. The CMake
script (CMakeLists.txt) downloads the QuickJS source code from its
repository and creates static library target for the JavaScript engine
which is then linked against the sample application embedding
QuickJS. This CMakeLists.txt script fully automates all steps, which relieves
the library user from installing QuickJS manually by using GNU make,
which is the original building system used by the engine.

** Chaiscript 

Scripting engine available as a header-only library that has
Javascript-like syntax and easy integration to C++ codebases.

Drawbacks: 
   + Header-only => Slow compile-time and large executable size due to
     the intesive use of templates. [[https://arne-mertz.de/2019/02/extern-template-reduce-compile-times/][Extern templates]] C++ language
     feature could reduce the compile time.

** Python Engine via Pybind11 

Documentation: 

  + [[https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/embedding.html][Pybind11 Embedding]]

Advantages: 
  + High popularity
  + Lost of libraries
  + Easy usage 

Drawbacks: 
  + Hard to static link
  + Not ligthweight and designed to be embedded as Lua.
  + It is not possible to run multiple instances of the Python
    interpreter.
  + It is not possible to sandbox the interpreter and restrict
    accessing files or process manipulation APIs.
  + Requires pre-installation of Python development headers. But, it
    can be mitigated by using Anaconda or miniconda Python distributions.

Known Cases: 
  + GDB - GNU Debugger 
  + IDA Debugger
  + Sublime Text Editor

** Scheme-like lisp interpreter 
*** Overview

Scheme is a simple dialect of lisp with several functional-programming
features. Functions are first class citizens, they can be passed as
argument to other functions and returned from functions. Everything is
an expression and evaluates to something, even assignments and if-else
statements. Some versions of scheme also feature tail-call
optimization that allow writing tail-recursive functions to be
converted to loop without creating excessive stack frames.

This section presents a lisp-like interpreter based on _Scheme_,
implemented using modern C++ features and object oriented design
patterns with a handwritten parser and lexer. This lisp interpreter is
based on [[https://norvig.com/lispy.html][lispy]], a lisp interpreter written in Python. Just like lispy,
this implementation is easy to understand and can be easily be embedded in
C++ applications for adding scripting capabilities or ursing
S-expressions as a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) or data description
language. 


Techniques used in this implementation: 

  + Smart pointers are used for memory managment.
    
  + _Composite design pattern_ for representing the AST

  + Visitor design pattern is used for traversing the AST and
    implementing AST printing. In a functional programming language
    with proper sum types (also known as variants or discriminated
    unions), the visitor could be replaced by _pattern matching_.

  + Inheritance is used for representing _sum types_ or _discriminated_
    _unitons_, common in functional programming languages.  The AST
    (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes, including atoms and lists, are
    represented by classes inheriting from _IEXpr_ abstract class.

  + The interpreter uses direct recursive evaluation of the AST just
    like the inspiration [[https://norvig.com/lispy.html][lispy]].

  + Lists are not implemented using linked lists, instead they are
    implemented using std::vector container.

  + Besides the recursive abstract syntax tree evaluation
    implementation, the interpreter could also be implemented using a
    SECD (stack-environment-control-dump) virtual machine.

  + This implementation uses the _fn_ keyword instead of _lambda_; _def_
    instead of _define_ for creating named functions; and _set_ instead of
    _define_ for defining variables.


Possible implementation techniques of Lisp-like languages: 

  + Recursive AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) evaluation
    
  + SECD (stack-environment-control-dump) virtual/abstract machine 

  + _Meta-circular evaluator_ => Implement lisp-like dialects on top of
    an existing lisp implementation such as Common Lisp.

  + Compile lisp dialect to bytecodes of an existing virtual machine
    including, JVM (Java Virtual Machine); CLR (Common Language
    Runtime) - .NET virtual machine; parrot virtual machine or WASM -
    Web Assembly.

  + JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler => Compile itself to machine code at
    runtime for improving performance and speed. This technique is
    used by several common lisp implementations.

  + Transpile S-expressions to another language, including C or C++.

Lisp terminology:

  + Sexp - S-Expression  
    + Stands for symbolic expressions
      
  + Homoiconicity
    + Code is data. The lisp code represents the AST (Abstract Syntax
      Tree) that is just nested lists of lists or atoms.

  + atoms
    + Everything that is not a list is an atom. An indivisible value,
      including strings, symbols, keywords, numbers and so on.
    
  + car - comes from 'Contents of the Address part of the Register'

  + cdr - comes from 'Contents of the Decrement part of the Register' 
    
  + cons -  abbreviation of the word 'construct'

  + Lisp 1 =>> There is a single namespace for variables and
    functions. Example: Scheme variants.

  + Lisp 2 =>> There are separate namespaces for variables and
    functions. Example: Common Lisp and Elisp - Emacs' lisp.

  + Special forms
    + They are forms or primitives not evaluated as functions, instead
      arguments may not be evaluated at all. Most special forms are
      primitives or control structures such as 'if', 'set', 'define', 'lambda'
      and so on. For instance the 'if' special form, that has three
      arguments, the first argument is a predicate, the second
      argument is the action that happens when the predicate is true
      and  the third argument is the action that happens when the
      predicate is false. If the predicate is true, the second
      argument is not evaluated and the if expression is evaluated to
      the value of the first argument. If the predicate is false, the
      first argument is not evaluated and the if expression is
      evaluated to the value of the second argument.

  + DSL - Domain Specific Lanaguage 

  + (if <PREDICATE> <THEN-EXPR> <ELSE-EXPR> )
    + The <THEN-EXPR> or then-expression is evaluated if the predicate
      evaulates to true that happens when the predicate does not
      evaluate to #f or nil. If the predicate is evaluated to any
      other value, the else-expression is evaluated.

  + User-defined procedures
    + User-defined functions using the keyword _fn_ (equivalent to
      lambda) or _def_ equivalent to Scheme's define keyword.

  + Primitive procedures 
    + Built-in functions or procedures, for instance (+), (*), apply,
      map, list and so on. 

  + Literals
    + Boolean literals => #t or #f - in this implementation
    + nil literal: nil => For designating empty return value.
    + symbol literal: 'a-symbol
    + keyword literal: :keyword1, :keyword2
    + String literal - between quotes:  "my string"
     

Known uses of Lisp-like languages as _configuration language_, _scripting_
_language_, _embedded scripting language_ or _extension language_:

  1. _Emacs text editor_ - uses its own Lisp dialect ELisp as a
     configuration language and scripting language. Note: Elisp is
     older than Scheme and Common Lisp.
    
  2. [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] functional package manager that uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU GUile]] as a
     configuration and scripting language. GNU Guix solves the Linux
     dependency hell problem by allowing reproducible installation of
     any package. This package manager also allows multiple versions
     of the same software to cohexis.

  3. _Autocad®_ from Autodesk - CAD (Computer Aided Design) software for
     engineering drawing that uses Autolisp, its own lisp dialect based
     on common lisp, as an embedded scripting language.

  4. [[https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Scheme2/][GNU Gimp]] - Image editor that uses [[https://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/home.html][TinyScheme]] as embedded
     scripting language.

  5. [[https://ubrigens.com/posts/sandbox_tour.html][Apple Sandbox]] - Uses TinyScheme as configuration language.

*** dotted list sexp parser algorithm

In traditional Scheme and Lisp implementations, lists are not
reprsented as vectors or arrays, instead they are represented as
linked list of cons, also called dotted pairs cells. Each cons cell
has two parts.  The first part _car_ points to another s-expression,
that either can be an atomic element or other cons cell. The second
part of a dotted pair, cons can point to another dotted pair, an empty
list or an atomic element. If the cons of the final dotted pair of a
list points to an empty list (nil in common lisp), the list is said to
be a _proper list_. If the dotted pair points to an atomic element, the
list is said to be an _improper list._


The terms car, cdr and cons, come from the following abbreviations:

  + car - comes from 'Contents of the Address part of the Register'

  + cdr - comes from 'Contents of the Decrement part of the Register' 
    
  + cons -  abbreviation of the word 'construct'

A single dotted pair (a . b) denoting an association of two atoms
'a' and 'b' can be represented with the following diagram.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
   (a . b) or (cons a b)

   +-----+-----+     
   | car | cdr | ---> b
   +-----+-----+     
      |              
     \ /             
      a              
#+END_SRC

According to this dotted-pairs or cons-cell linked lista approach, a
list (a b c) is represented as:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
   representation 1: (cons a (cons b (cons c nil)))

A proper list, such as (a b c d), is terminated in nil as shown in the
following diagram:

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
   cons(a, cons(b, cons(c, cons(d, nil))) 
   (a . (b . (c . (d . nil))))
#+END_SRC

An improper list, such as (a b . c), is terminated in a non nil or non
empty-list atom. The next diagram show how this list is represented in
memory.

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
   cons(a, cons(b, c))

#+END_SRC

The EBNF grammar of this dotted-pairs linked list can be specified as follow:

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
   sexp := atom | pair | list 
   pair := "(" sexp "." sexp ")"
   list := "(" sexp* ")"
   atom := NUMBER 
         | SYMBOL 
         | STRING 
         | BOOLEAN 
         | SYMBOL 
         | NULL 
#+END_SRC

The AST can be represnted using OCaml algebraic data type notation as:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp 
   type sexp = num  of int          // number literal 
             | sym of string        // symbol, identifier or keyword
             | str  of string       // string literal between quotes ""
             | bool of boolean      // boolean literak #t or #f 
             | nil                  // represents null value 
             | cons of sexp * sexp  // cons cell => It can represent a null-terminated

*** sexp parser algorithm without dotted list

Besides the dotted-pair approach that represents S-expressions as
linked lists of cons cells, S-expresions can also be represented by
nested lists or arrays. This approach is more suitable for data
exchange and serialization. Other advantage is the easier and quickier
implementation of a lisp-like embedded scripting languages hosted in a
garbage collected statically typed languages such as Java or
C#. Unlike the dotted-pair AST - abstract syntax tree, this type of AST
cannot represent improper lists.


EBNF for Lisp/Scheme Sexp S-Expression without cons pairs linked list:

** Expression interpreter 
*** Overview 

The following source code provides an implementation of an interpreter
that able evaluate infix math expressions, with mathematics operator
precendence rules, and programming constructs including if-else
statements, while loop, for loop, function calls and function
definition. The application is comprised of three parts a lexer and
evaluator. The tokenizer, also known as tokenizer, is a component that
breaks the source code into lexical units called tokens. In this case,
a token is a struct containing the token _lexeme_, a string that
represents the token; the token _type_ enumeration, which indicates
whether the token is a number, a keyword or a string; and metadata
related to the token position, column and line in the source code. The
parser component takes the token stream generated by the tokenizer as
input and produces an _AST - Abstract Syntax Tree_ using a recursive
descent parsing algorithm that consists of mutually recursive
functions, each implementing a non-terminal grammar symbol. The final
part of the expression interpreter is an AST evaluator, that traverses
the AST - Abstract Syntax Tree nodes generated by the parser in a
recursive way for producing runtime values, that represents all
possible computation results. 

The techniques adopted in this sample code, can be used for
implementing formula evaluators, spreadsheets, CAS - Computer Algebra
Ssystems, DSL - Domain Specific Languages or embedded scripting
languages for allowing extending applications at runtime. Despite that
the C++ was used for implementing this interpreter, the algorithm can
easily be implemented in any other programming language and rewritten
in a more concise way in functional programming languages with pattern
matching and algebraic data types. For instance, in a functional
programming language, the visitor design pattern could be replaced by
a more concise pattern matching and the class hierarchies representing
the AST - Abstract Syntax Tree and interpreter runtime values could be
replaced by algebraic data types.


This parser implements the following grammar stated in ANTLR-style
EBNF (Extended Backnaur notation). The syntax of programming
constructs were borrowed from Basic and Pascal programming languages.

 *BNF - Backus-Naur and grammar-related terminology*

  + _CFG_ - Context-Free Grammar
    + As opposite to CSG - Context-Sensitive Grammars, production
      rules of CFG grammars does not depend on the context. This type
      of grammar can be described by BNF or EBFN notation.  
    
  + _CSG_ - Context-Sensitive Grammar 
    + Grammar which production rules are context-sensitive and depends
      on the current context. The C and C++ programming languages grammars are
      context-sensitive, since the interpretation of many programming
      constructs are context-dependent. For instance, the meaning of
      T * X in C and are dependent on the context, if T is type, such
      as int, then X is a pointer variable. If both X and T are of
      type int, float or any other numeric type, then the expression
      is a multiplication between variables T and X.

  + CFG - _Control Flow Graph_

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%25E2%2580%2593Naur_form][BNF]] - Backus-Naur Normal Form
    + Notation introduced by John Backus and Peter Naur for formally
      describing _context-free grammars_, which are _not_
      _context-sensitive_ and not ambiguous. For instance C and C++
      grammars are not context-free grammars since the meaning of an
      expressions depends on the context, whether the symbol is a
      function, pointer, class and so on.

    + Modified Back-Naur Form notation for describing bidirectional
      communication protocols. This notation is used to describe the
      Http protocol, FTP protocol and other network protocols.

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTLR][ANTLR]] - _ANother Tool For Language Recognition_
    + Open source tool written in Java that takes an ANTLR-style EBNF
      grammar and generates a parser for this grammar in a given
      target language, such as Python, Ruby, Perl, Go (Golang), Java,
      C# (CSharp), C, C++, JavaScript (ECMAScript), PHP and
      Swift. ANTLR is one of the most used tools for generating
      parsers and lexers/tokenizers. This parser generator tool has
      its own EBNF grammar style that does not conform to ISO/IEC
      14977 technical standard.

  + _Parsing_ - process of turning a string from text or source code
    into some data structure such as AST - Abstract Syntax
    Tree. Example, turning a string containing a JSON (Java-Script
    Object) notation code into a tree-like data structure.

  + _AST_ - Abstract Syntax Tree 
    + Data structure that describes a tree representation of the
      source code used as input of compiler code generators, bytecode
      code generators, interpreters and pretty printers.

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model][DOM]] - Document Object Model 
    + Abstract Syntax Tree representation of an XML or HTML
      document. Whenever a web page is loaded, the web browser turns
      the html code into a DOM object, a tree-like representatio the
      html source code that is exposed to the JavaScript (ECMaScript)
      code.

  + DAG - Direct Acyclic Graph 

  + _SEXP_ S-Expression from Lisp 
    + Lisp S-expressions are one of the most convenient and compact to
      represent AST - Abstract Syntax Trees as text.  

  + _Top-down Recursive Descent Parsing_ or just _Recursive Descent Parsing_
    + Parser algorithm that uses mutually recursive functions or
      methods for each non-terminal production rule. Despite the
      simplicity of implementation of this parsing technique, it has
      few shortcomings such as not being able to deal with
      left-recursive and ambiguous grammars.

  + _TDOP - Top-Down Operator Precedence Parser_ (the same as _Pratt Parser_)
    + Parser algorithm that can parse infix, prefix and postfix
      expressions different operator precedence levels without a
      non-terminal grammar rule for every precedence level. This
      algorithm is more flexible than Top-Down Recursive Descent
      Parsing since new operator precedence levels can be added
      without modifying the grammar or adding new recursive function.

  + _Shunting-yard algorithm_ (Edsger Dijkstra)
    + This algorithm uses a stack for turning infix expressions into
      postfix expression, RPL - Reverse Polish Notation, which is
      suitable for direct evaluation of infix expressions. Unlike
      other algorithms, the output is not an AST - Abstract Syntax
      Tree. Therefore, if an AST is needed, an additional algorithm
      will be required for turning the postfix output into an AST.

    operator such as (plus): lhs + rhs.

  + RHS - Right-Hand Side, often the right-hand side of an infix
    operator such as (star): lhs * rhs.

  + _terminals_ - (ANTLR) are written with upper case letters, for
    instance, IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, ...
    + A Terminal symbol is just a single token that represents
      an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) node without any child AST
      nodes. For instance, terminal symbols are string literals;
      boolean literals (True, False in Python); integer literals;
      floating point literals and so on.

  + _non-terminals_ - (ANTLR) are written using camel-case or
    snake-case convention. For instance: expr, program, ~for_loop~.
    + A non-terminal symbol are symbols comprised of multiple terminal
      symbols or tokens. Non-terminal symbols correponds to AST -
      Abstract Syntax Tree nodes with multiple AST child nodes. For
      instance, non-terminal symbols are often if-else statement,
      for-loop statement, while-loop and so on.

    _left-recursion_ by indicating an empty string. This notation is not
    used by EBFN, that uses an empty string instead of any special
    notation. 


 *Performance Optimization for Interpreters*

  
   + Compilation to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine][virtual machine]]
     + Most programming languages interpreter engines do not execute
       AST nodes directly, instead they compile the source code to
       bytecodes, which are a instructions for some virtual machine.
       
   + Compilation to a standardized virtual machine
     + Rather than implementing its own bytecode virtual machine, a
       programming language could use a standardized bytecode virtual
       machine runtimes that are exposed to external use and not
       likely to have breaking changes on every release since they are
       regarded as public APIs and interfaces. Some of these virtual
       machines, that are a compilation target of many programming
       languages, are _JVM_ - Java Virtual Machine, used by Jython
       (Python for JVM), Clojure and Groovy; _CRL_ - Commong Language
       Runtime (.NET Virtual Machine), use by C# (CSharp), F#
       (FSharp), IronPython; and _WASM_ - Web Assembly. 

   + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation][JIT - Just-In-Time compilation]] 
     + Compilation of bytecodes (virtual machine instructions) to
       machine code (also known as native code) at runtime. This
       processs combines the advantage of interpretation and
       compilation to native code. The shortcoming of this approach is
       the loss of flexibility and portability, since the JIT has to
       be ported to every processor architecture where the virtual
       machine will be deployed.

   + FFI - Foreign Function Interface
     + FFI allows loading native code shared libraries, which may be written
       in C, C++, Rust, D (Dlang), exposing a C interface and C symbols.

   + Native Extension API 
     + A plugin system that allows loading libraries provided as
       shared libraries (*.so - files on Linux, BSD; *.dylib on MacOSX
       or *.dll on Windows), written in C, C++, Rust or any other
       language that compiles to native code, conforming to an
       expected C interface. Example: Java's JNI that allows loading
       Java Libraries written in C or C++ that conforms to the JNI API
       by using JNI SDK - Software Development Kit.
