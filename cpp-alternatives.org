* Alternatives to C++
** Overview 

This notes provides alternatives to C++ programming language that can
fulfill the following requirements: 

 + Native code compilation
 + System programming language
 + No or optional garbage collector
 + High performance as C++
 + Compatibility with C or how easier is to call C-APIs (C-functions and structures).

Niches where C++ is used: 

 * HPC - High Performance Computing

 * Games and computer graphics 
   * Requirements: high performance and soft real time system.

 * System Programming
   * Kernel mode programming; device drivers; hardware interface;
     foundation libraries such as user interface toolkits and so on.  

 * Embedded Systems (also can be regarded as system programming)
   + Resource constrained systems => Firmware running in
     microcontrollers or embedded computers.

Some Reasonable Features that a _System Programming Language_ should have: 

 + Native compilation 

 + Bare metal compilation - compilation for running the program or
   firmware without an operating system (bare metal mode).

 + Be able to run without garbarge collector or to disable garbarge
   collector in resource constrained systems.

 + Interoperability with C

 + Support C calling convention and calling C APIs and functions

 + Inline assembly 

 + Support for Pointers

 + Memory reinterpretation - ability to cast pointers in order to
   access memory-mapped IO in kernel mode or in embedded devices. 

What should be taken into consideration: 

 * Tooling support:
   + IDE - Integrated Development Support
   + Refatoring tools 
   + Debuggers 
   + Profilers for measuring peformance

 * _IDE Support_ - some IDE services are invaluable such as:

   + code completion
     * improves API discoverability and saves user time.

   + code navigation
     + makes easier to view and jump between functions, classes,
       definitions and files. 

   + code refactoring
     * allows safe and fast changes such as renaming,
       changing method signature and so on.

   + Debugging interface
     * Debuggers help fixing bugs by introspecting the program
       execution state and control flow at any given time and also
       allows user manipulation of program state and variables. 

 * Compile-time speed 

 * Availability of documentation and examples 

 * Network Effect => Enough critical mass that enables community
   support and enough libraries.

 * Availability of general and domain-specific libraries 

 * Hardware Support 
   + Availability of compilers for different hardwares
   + Support from IC (Integrated Circuits) or Hardware Vendors 

** General Purpose
*** D Language 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)][D (DLang or D-Language)]] (2001)

    + Official Web Site: https://dlang.org/

    + The D Language was created by _Walter Bright_, a former Mechanical
      Engineer at Boeing and the creator of the first true C++
      compiler Zortech C++. When the C++ was created, it was first
      implemented as a preprocessor for generating C code.

    + Note: some people claim that D looks like a "compiled Python"

    + Features:

      + Multi-Paradigm
        + Imperative
        + Object Oriented Programming
        + Metaprogramming
        + Functional
        + Concurrent - actor model 

      + Native code compilation

      + Much faster compile-time, D can even by used as a
        statically-typed [[https://dlang.org/rdmd.html][scripting language.]]

      + Optional garbage collection => it can be disabled in
        application where it is not acceptable such as audio, system
        programming and games. 

      + Modules

      + Design-by-contract

      + Metaprogramming Support

      + More comprehensive standard library
        + https://dlang.org/phobos/

      + Interoperability: 

        + [[https://dlang.org/spec/interfaceToC.html][Interoperability with C]] 
          + Supports calling C functions directly, although it does not
            support including C header files.

        + [[https://dlang.org/spec/cpp_interface.html][Interoperability with C++]]
          + D is one of the few languages that understands the C++ ABI
            and allows calling C++ from D and D from C++.

        + Interoperability with Assembly
          + Supports inline assembly

      + Built-in package manager and building system - *dub*

      + Central package repository: https://code.dlang.org

    + Fixes lots of C++ problems due to earlier design decisions:

      + Classes are _reference types_ => They are passed by reference by
        default as in most language, instead of being passed by value
        as in C++ which may incurr on copy-constructing overhead. It
        simplifies the language as one does not need to care about
        copy-constructors or move-constructors.

      + Provides _value types_ or structs that are passed by value by
        default just as in C++.

      + Fixes C++ multiple-inheritance diamond-of-death problem by
        allowing only single inheritance with multiple interface
        inheritance in a similar fashion to Java. 

      + Provides ranges instead of iterator pair.

      + Modules, instead of C preprocessor which reduces the compile-time.

    + Problems:
      + Plugins for enabling D language support in existing IDEs
        don't work out of the box.
      + Less tooling than C++
      + Lower popularity than Golang, Rust and so on.
      + Smaller community 
      + Less IDE support and refactoring tools.

*** Rust 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)][Rust]] - (2010) Created by Mozzila Foundation
    + Official Web Site: https://www.rust-lang.org/
    + Features:
      + Compilation to native code
      + No gabarge collector
      + Based on ML functional programming languages such as Haskell,
        OCaml and so on.
      + Type inference
      + Modules
      + No header-files code duplication nightmare.
      + Package manager: [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html][cargo]]
    + Problems:
      + Slow compile-time 
      + Cannot call C-libraries directly as C++ - [[https://blog.jfo.click/calling-a-c-function-from-rust/][ref1]]
      + Less available libraries as C++
      + Lack of compilers for embedded targets can be a problem for
        embedded systems development.
      + Does not support custom allocators as C++.
      + Not supported in many hardware types as C++ or C.
    + See:
      + [[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/application-development/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html][What is the Rust language? Safe, fast, and easy software development | InfoWorld]]

*** Golang 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)][Go - Golang]] (2009)

    + Official Web Site: https://golang.org/

    + Programming language created at Google by Robert Griesmer, Rob
      Pike and Ken Thompson.

    + Features:
      + Most used for Network Servers, Web Servers, Web Applications,
        distributed systems and message systems due its concurrency
        features such as go-routines based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes][Hoare's CSP]] -
        Communicating Sequential Processes. 
      + Lightweight threads (user-space threads)
      + Gabarge collector.
      + Fast compile-time to native code 
      + Statically-linked native executables that can be deployed
        without any dependencies.
      + Multiple return values
      + Reflexion 
      + Avoids unsafe pointer arithmetics.
      + Array-bound checking.

    + Drawbacks:
      + First weakness is the "ungoogable name" "go" which is hard to
        search about without getting many unrelated results, better
        search for "golang" or "go programming".
      + Lack of generics and template metaprogramming.
      + Gabarge collector can be a curse for the applications that C++
        shines, namely, system programming, embedded systems, real-time
        systems (including games) and high performance computing.

*** ATS - Applied Type System 

  + [[http://www.ats-lang.org/Documents.html][ATS Programming Language]] (2015)
    + Official Web Site: http://www.ats-lang.org/
    + Community: http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/COMMUNITY/
    + ATS stands for Applied Type System
    + Suitability:
      + Systems Programming 
      + Device drivers
      + Embedded Systems
      + High performance libraries
    + Features:
      + Statically-typed functional programming language based on
        Standard ML (OCaml) that transpile to C, or generate C-code.
      + C-interoperability
      + Can take advantage of the availability of C-compilers for many
        platforms, hardwares and devices. 
      + Memory-safe
      + All ML perks: pattern matching; algebraic data types and so on.
      + Can run without garbage collector.
      + Can compile or generate code to: C, JavaScript and Erlang.
    + Problem:
      + New programming language 
      + May not be mature enough.
      + Sparse documentation

*** NIM 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language)][Nim Language]] (2008)
    + Official Web Site: https://nim-lang.org/
    + Features:
      + Native code compilation by generating C-code (Nim is a transpiler)
      + Simple syntax
      + Gabarge Collection 
    + Problems:
      + Did not reach version 1.0 yet. Still under development.
      + Less tooling support.
      + Gabarge Collection can also be a problem in
        performance-critical applications.

*** Crystal 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)][Crystal Programming language]] (2014)
    + Official Web Site: https://crystal-lang.org/
    + Github: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal

** Scientific and numerical computing

+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran][Fortran]] (1954)
  + Fortran (Formula Translation), designed by John Backus at IBM in
    1954, was the first high level programming language which the
    purpose was to assist physics and engineering calculations. The
    reason why Fortran was math-centric is that computers were
    initially developed for number crunching and earlier devices
    called computers such as slide rules, abacus and analog computers
    were built for numerical computations, solving differential
    equations or peform control system tasks.
  + Features:
    + Array-based notation
    + Matrix and array indexes starting with 1 instead of 0.
    + Compilation to native code
    + Fortran libraries can be called and used from C or C++.
    + Lots of legacy domain-specific code for science, physics and
      engineering are available in Fortran.
  + Problem:
    + Pretty old programming language.
    + No longer widely used.
    + Open source Fotran compilers such as GFortran (GNU Fortran)
      cannot match the performance of expensive proprietary
      compilers. 
    + Domain-specific.
** Embedded, Real Time Systems and Safety-Critical System 

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)][Ada - programming language]] (1980)

  + Native code compilation, stronger static typing than C++; more
    memory-safe than C or C++; no gabarge-collector; pascal-based;
    built-in design-by-contract; concurrency in the language
    specification.

** Graphical User Interface RAD - Rapid Application Development

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(IDE)][Free Pascal Programming Language + Lazarus]]
    + Official Web Site: https://www.lazarus-ide.org/
    + Other sites:
      + http://wiki.freepascal.org/
      + http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/
    + Lazarus is an open source IDE for Object Pascal programming
      language where is possible to build graphical user interface
      fast visually by picking and placing user interface components in
      the same fashion as Visual Basic or Borland Delphi (now
      Embarcadero Delphi).
    + Features:
      + Based on Borland Delphi
      + Compilation to native code
      + Much Faster compile-time than C++
      + Can ship the application as a single executable which makes the
        deployment of Desktop GUI apps easier.
      + Build graphical user interfaces fast by dragging and dropping UI
        components like in Visual Basic 6 or Embarcadero (Old Borland)
        Delphi.
      + Static compilation with all dependencies.
      + Cross-platform - the same project can be recompiled with the
        IDE on Windows, Linux and Mac-OSX. 
      + Lots of built-in user interface components
      + Can reuse Delphi components
      + Lots of database connectivity components
      + Ability to call C-APIs, C-code and shared libraries. C++ code
        can be called with a C-interface (extern "C" ...)
    + Problems:
      + Some people may not like object-pascal syntax that is different
        from the C-like syntax.
      + Small community
      + Scattered documentation
      + Without proper discipline, the application can easily become an
        spaghetti as it is easier to mix the application code with the
        graphical user interface GUI code, although this shortcoming can
        be mitigated with MVC - Model View Controller.

      + [[http://wiki.freepascal.org/Lazarus_Application_Gallery][Lazarus Application Gallery]] (full list of applications)
** C++ code as a component or as Library

  + *Shared Library with C-interface*
    + The C++ code can be turned into a shared library by manually
      writting a C-interface (lots of extern "C") that can be loaded
      from any programming language via foreign-function interface
      such as Python C-types, Java JNA or .NET / C# P-invoke.

  + *Shared Library with Programming Language Specific C native interface*
    + Many programming languages such as Python, Ruby or Java (JNI) are
      written in C or C++ and provide a native interface API where is
      possible to create native modules or libraries in C and load
      them as they were ordinary libraries. So, a C++ code can be
      turned into a Python library by compiling the code with its
      bindings or adapter code for Python native API. The drawback of
      this approach is that, it will be hard to reuse the library with
      other programming languages.

  + *Swig Wrapper Genrator*
    + The SWIG wrapper generator parses Swing interface files, C and
      C++ header files and then generates binding code for a native C
      interface of some specified programming language. So, SWIG can
      generate native Python, Ruby or Java and other languages native
      libraries.
** C++ with Embedded Scripting Languages

Embedded programming languages can make easier for non-technical or
non-programming users to extend, configure and customize applications
without any recompilation. They also allow end users to build add-ons,
extensions or plugins. This approach is widely used by games for
allowing non-programmers to create higher level logic, gameplay,
animation and mods. Some programming languages were designed
specifically to be embedded:

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl][TCL - Tool Command Language]] (1988)
    * Widely used as embedded scripting language in EDA - Electronic
      Design Automation Tool. This happens due to the language
      creator, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout][John Ousterhout]], initially develped TCL as an
      scripting extension language for EDA applications.

      * [[https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Who+Uses+Tcl][Who uses TCL]]

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)][Lua]] (Moon in Portuguese) Programming Language (1993)
    + Feature: Lua programming language is lightweight and minimal
      and avaialable as C-library easier to be embedded in a C or C++
      application.
    + Used in:
      + Games;
      + Nginx web server;
      + LuaTex;
      + MediaWiki (Wikipedia   wiki engine) - uses lua as a template engine
      + Nmap network scanner

  * [[https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html][Python]] (CPython implementation) (1991)
    * As Python is written in C, its runtime can be embedded in a C++
      application allowing it to be extended and customized by
      end-users and take advantage of users previous knowledge as
      Python is being used more and more for introducing
      programming. The disadvantage is that Python it is not so
      lightweight as language designed to be embedded in other
      applications and its native interface C-API is harder to use.

      * Note: The header-only library [[https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Pybind11]] makes easier to embed
        Python in C++ applications.

      interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can also
      compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
      compiler "mrbc". All those tools reside in the "bin"
      directory. "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte code
      in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under the "test"
      directory for an example."
