* Alternatives to C++
** Overview 

This notes provides alternatives to C++ programming language that can
fulfill the following requirements: 

 + Native code compilation
 + System programming language
 + No or optional garbage collector
 + High performance as C++
 + Compatibility with C or how easier is to call C-APIs (C-functions and structures).

 *Niches where C++ is used*

   * HPC - High Performance Computing
     * CFD => Computational Fluid Dynamics (See: OpenFoam library)
     * FEM => Finite Element Methods 
     * Computational Engineering
     * Oil and Gas
     * Geophysics 
     * Astrophysics 
     * Particle Physics
     * High Energy Physics

   * Games and computer graphics 
     * Requirements: high performance and soft real time system.

   * System Programming
     * Kernel mode programming; device drivers; hardware interface;
       foundation libraries such as user interface toolkits and so on.  

   * Embedded Systems (also can be regarded as system programming)
     + Resource constrained systems => Firmware running in
       microcontrollers, embedded computers, SBC - Single Board
       Computers and so on.
     + IoT - Internet Of Things

   * Foundational Libraries and software infrastructure:

     + Database servers
       + MySQL (C and C++)
       + [[https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/src/][MongdoDB]] 
       + [[https://github.com/scylladb/scylla][ScyllaDB]]

     + Operating Systems
       + Note: despite that most operating system used nowadays were
         written in C, it is possible to create operating systems or
         embedded operating systems in C++.

     + Device Drivers

     + Firmware 

     + High performance math libraries that can be called from any
       programming language via foreign-function-interface or
       native-extension API (similar to JNI - Jave Native Interface).

     + GUI - Graphical User Interface Libraries
       + Qt 
       + WxWidgets

 *Features of System Programming Languages* 

Some reasonable features that a *System Programming Language* should
have are: 

  * Compilation to native code

  * _Stack allocation_ - Note: Most programming languages does not
    alllocate on the stack virtual memory segment of a process, only a
    few system programming languages are able to do it. 

  * _Bare metal_ compilation - compilation without operating system, for
    building kernel or firmware (embedded systems' program).

  * Be able to run _without garbarge collector_ or to _disable garbarge_
    _collector_ in resource constrained systems.

  * _Interoperability with C_ - Support C calling convention and linking
    against C APIs and functions. 
    + Languages with this feature: C++; [[https://dlang.org/spec/interfaceToC.html][DLang]] (D programming
      language); [[https://medium.com/dwelo-r-d/using-c-libraries-in-rust-13961948c72a][Rust]]; [[http://www.inspirel.com/articles/Ada_On_Cortex_Mixing_Ada_With_C.html][ADA]];
    + Operating systems often expose functionalities and encapsulated
      system-calls for user-space applications via C libraries or
      runtime libraries exposing functions and symbols with C-calling
      convention and C-ABI (Application Binary Interface). Aside that,
      many foundational libraries are implemented in C or exposing C
      compatible-symbols, such as OpenGL API; OpenSSL; GTK GUI
      libraries and so on.

  * _extern-"C"_ like statements - Support for creating C-compatible
    functions with C-calling convention. 
    + Languages with this feature: [[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19059-01/wrkshp50/805-4956/bajdcjch/index.html][C++]]; [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/255741/can-you-call-ada-functions-from-c][ADA]]; [[https://dev.to/dandyvica/how-to-call-rust-functions-from-c-on-linux-h37][Rust]]; [[https://dlang.org/articles/dll-linux.html#dso9][DLang]] (D
      programming language); [[https://macpgmr.github.io/MacXPlatform/PascalDynLibs.html][Pascal]]; [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8207997/calling-a-fortran-subroutine-from-c][Fortran]] (Note: no a system
      prog. language).
    + Many operating systems, including Windows-NT and Linux and other
      Unix-like ones, define a C standard calling convention and ABI,
      which is the common denominator for binary interoperability. As
      a result, system programming languages, such as C++, DLang and
      Rust, provide _extern-C_ like annotations for defining functions
      with C calling convention and C-ABI that allows calling those
      functions from any other language supporting C ABI or via FFI
      (Foreign-Function Interface).
    + This type of annotation allows creating: C-compatible libraries
      in C++ or Rust; Python native code modules (shared libraries) in
      C++ or Rust; create shared libraries that can be loaded via FFI
      foreign function interface from interpred languages such as
      Python, Ruby, JavaScript (NodeJS) and so on.

  * _Inline assembly_  - Some sitatutions where inline assembly is needed are:
    + SIMD (Single-Instruction and Multiple Data) which is provide data
      parallelism, which is essential for high perfomance computing.
    + Access port-mapped IO instructions on x86 or x86-64
      architecture.
    + Define functions with another calling convention. 
    + Define ISR - interrupt-service routines, which may use other
      calling conventions.
    + Invoke operating systems' system calls.
    + Create CRT (C runtime libraries), such as GLIBC or MUSL that
      encapsulate system calls. 

  * _Support for Pointers_
    + Memory reinterpretation - ability to cast pointers in order to
      access memory-mapped IO in kernel mode or in embedded devices. 


 *What should be taken into consideration*

  * Standardization 

  * Availability of documentation and examples.

  * Reasonable standard library. 

  * Availability of general and domain-specific libraries 

  * Network Effect => Enough critical mass that enables community
    support and enough libraries.

  * Hardware Support: 
    + Availability of compilers for different hardwares such as CPU
      core architectures; microcontrollers, DSP - Dgitial Signal
      Processors and so on. 
    + Support from IC (Integrated Circuits) or Hardware Vendors 

  * Compile-time speed:
    + Compile-time has a great extent of productivity implications as
      the workflow on many compiled-programming languages is edit,
      compile, fix compile-time errors and run. 

  * Tooling support:
    + IDE - Integrated Development Support
    + Refatoring tools 
    + Debuggers 
    + Profilers for measuring peformance

  * _IDE Support_ - some IDE services are invaluable such as:

    + code completion
      * Improves code discoverability and saves time that would be
        spent browsing the documentation or searching the source
        code. 

    + code navigation
      + makes easier to view and jump between functions, classes,
        definitions and files. This service is essential for dealing
        with large code bases with hundreds or thousands of files. 

    + Code refactoring => refactoring menu. 
      * allows safe and fast changes such as renaming,
        changing method signature and so on.

    + Debugging interface to GDB, WindDBG (Windows Debugger), LLVM and so on.
      * Debuggers help fixing bugs by introspecting the program
        execution state and control flow at any given time and also
        allows user manipulation of program state and variables.

    + Integration with revision control systems or version control
      system such as GIT, SVN and etc.

 *Major Problems of C++*

 + Slow compile-time 

 + No pre-compiled libraries, project dependencies have to be
   compiled from source due to ABI incompatibility. This is why
   header-only libraries are popular. 

 + Lack of module system 

 + Macros and preprocessor

 + Code repetitition, every class' source file .cpp needs a matching
   header file which is not an interface as it exposes implementation
   details, for instance, the signature of private functions and
   private member variables need to be in header files. 

 + Undefined behavior
   + Undefined behavior may cause bad surprises as it can cause bugs
     that are hard to detect and may go under the radar for a long
     time allowing a program to run with unpredictable and/or invalid
     state.

 + Object Model

   + => C++ uses multiple inheritance that has been proved to be
     flawed as it can cause the infamous diamond-of-death problem.
     Most object oriented programming languages solved it by only
     allowing single inheritance with multiple interface inheritance.

   + => Value semantics: C++ treats classes as primitive value and
     performs deep copy and passes all parameters by copy by default,
     however most of the time, classes are intended to be passed by
     reference and not by copy and it has to be done explicitly.

   + => Value semantics does not work with polymorphic types.

   + => Object Slicing 

 + High Degree of Complexity

 + Binary compatibility among compilers.

 + Lack of ABI makes unfeasible to build C++ components or shared
   libraries without a C API. In C#, the user has just to add a DLL
   and in Java, the user has just to add jar package to include a
   dependency in a project. In C++, it is not possible, all
   dependencies need to compiled from source.

 + Complexity of building systems 

 + No Standard Tooling - Despite that there are some widely used
   tools such as CMake "building system", they are still no
   standard. So, as result there are no:
   + NO standard package manager 
   + NO standard building system

** General Purpose
*** D Language 

 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)][D (DLang or D-Language)]] (2001)

Overview: 

  + Official Web Site: https://dlang.org/

  + The D Language was created by _Walter Bright_, a former Mechanical
    Engineer at Boeing and the creator of the first true C++ compiler
    Zortech C++. D was also co designed by _Andrei_ _Alexandrescu_, a
    well-known C++ speaker, guru and author of the revolutionary book:
    'Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied'.

  + Note: When the C++ was created, it was first implemented as a
    preprocessor for generating C code.

  + Note: some people claim that D looks like a "compiled Python"

Features:

    + Multi-Paradigm
      + Imperative
      + Object Oriented Programming
      + Metaprogramming
      + Functional
      + Concurrent - actor model

    + Easier to learn for a C or C++ developer than Rust.

    + Inspired by: C, C++, C# (Csharp), Eiffel, Java and Python.

    + Native code compilation with static linking.

    + Much faster compile-time, D can even by used as a
      statically-typed [[https://dlang.org/rdmd.html][scripting language.]]

    + Optional garbage collection => it can be disabled in
      application where it is not acceptable such as audio, system
      programming and games. 

    + Modules

    + Design-by-contract

    + Metaprogramming Support

    + More comprehensive standard library
      + https://dlang.org/phobos/

    + Built-in package manager and building system - *dub*

    + Central package repository: https://code.dlang.org

Interoperability: 

    + [[https://dlang.org/spec/interfaceToC.html][Interoperability with C]] 
      + Supports calling C functions directly, although it does not
        support including C header files.

    + [[https://dlang.org/spec/cpp_interface.html][Interoperability with C++]]
      + D is one of the few languages that understands the C++ ABI
        and allows calling C++ from D and D from C++.

    + [[https://dlang.org/spec/objc_interface.html][Interoperability with Objective-C]]

    + Interoperability with Assembly
      + Supports inline assembly

Fixes lots of C++ problems due to earlier design decisions:

   + Classes are _reference types_ => Instead of being passed by value
     by default, they are passed by reference implicitly without the
     C++ annotations for reference (&) or const referece(const &). It
     simplifies the language as one does not need to care about
     copy-constructors, move-constructors or potential problems of
     copy-constructor deep-copy or copy-overhead.

   + Provides structs that are _value types_ like all C++ types and by
     value by default just as in C++ and C#. D Structs also allows
     RAII Resource-Acquisition-Is-Initialization technique for
     resource handling. 

   + Fixes C++ multiple-inheritance diamond-of-death problem by
     allowing only single inheritance with multiple interface
     inheritance in a similar fashion to Java.

   + Fixes the object-slicing problem that happens when a polymorphic
     type is returned or passed by value losing its polymorphic
     abilities.  

   + Provides ranges instead of complicated and non-composable iterator pair.

   + Modules, instead of C preprocessor which dramatically reduces the compile-time.

Problems:
    + Plugins for enabling D language support in existing IDEs
      don't work out of the box.
    + Less tooling than C++
    + Lower popularity than Golang, Rust and so on.
    + Smaller community 
    + Less IDE support and refactoring tools.

*** ATS - Applied Type System 

 [[http://www.ats-lang.org/Documents.html][ATS Programming Language]] (2015)

  + Official Web Site: http://www.ats-lang.org/
  + Community: http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/COMMUNITY/
  + ATS stands for Applied Type System

 Suitability:
    + Systems Programming 
    + Device drivers
    + Embedded Systems
    + High performance libraries

Features:
    + Statically-typed functional programming language based on
      Standard ML (OCaml) that transpile to C, or generate C-code.
    + C-interoperability
    + Can take advantage of the availability of C-compilers for many
      platforms, hardwares and devices. 
    + Memory-safe
    + All ML perks: pattern matching; algebraic data types and so on.
    + Can run without garbage collector.
    + Can compile or generate code to: C, JavaScript and Erlang.

Problem:
    + New programming language 
    + May not be mature enough.

*** Golang 

 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)][Go - Golang]] (2009)

  + Official Web Site: https://golang.org/

  + Programming language created at Google by Robert Griesmer, Rob
      Pike and Ken Thompson.

 Features:

   + Most used for Network Servers, Web Servers, Web Applications,
     distributed systems and message systems due its concurrency
     features such as go-routines based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes][Hoare's CSP]] -
     Communicating Sequential Processes.

   + Easier to learn for developers coming from languages such as
     Java, Python, and so on. 

   + Lightweight threads (user-space threads)

   + Gabarge collector.

   + Fast compile-time to native code 

   + Statically-linked native executables that can be deployed
     without any dependencies.

   + Multiple return values

   + Reflexion 

   + Avoids unsafe pointer arithmetics.

   + Array-bound checking.

Drawbacks:
 
  + "Ungoogable name" "go" which is hard to search about without
    getting many unrelated results as "go" is one of the most common
    words of the English Language, better search for "golang" or "go
    programming". 

  + Lack of generics and template metaprogramming.

  + Lack of exceptions

  + Lack of ternary operators 

  + Gabarge collector can be a curse for the applications that C++
      shines, namely, system programming, embedded systems, real-time
      systems (including games) and high performance computing.

Best use-cases: 

  + Command line tools
    + => GO is suitable for building portable command line
      applications, due to the compilation to native executable and
      static linking of dependencies which allows seamless
      deployment and portability across many Linux distributions. 

  + Network Services; aka servers; web servers; TCP or UDP servers.

  + Distributed systems.

High Profile Software built with Golang: 

  + Docker 

  + Kubernetes (k8)

  + Ubuntu Snap package manager (developed by Canonical)

*** NIM 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language)][Nim Language]] (2008)
    + Official Web Site: https://nim-lang.org/
    + Features:
      + Native code compilation by generating C-code (Nim is a transpiler)
      + Simple syntax
      + Gabarge Collection 
    + Problems:
      + Did not reach version 1.0 yet. Still under development.
      + Less tooling support.
      + Gabarge Collection can also be a problem in
        performance-critical applications.

*** Crystal 

  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)][Crystal Programming language]] (2014)
    + Official Web Site: https://crystal-lang.org/
    + Github: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal

** Scientific and numerical computing

   * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran][Fortran]] (1954)
     + Fortran (Formula Translation), designed by John Backus at IBM in
       1954, was the first high level programming language which the
       purpose was to assist physics and engineering calculations. The
       reason why Fortran was math-centric is that computers were
       initially developed for number crunching and earlier devices
       called computers such as slide rules, abacus and analog computers
       were built for numerical computations, solving differential
       equations or peform control system tasks.
     + Features:
       + Array-based notation
       + Matrix and array indexes starting with 1 instead of 0.
       + Compilation to native code
       + Fortran libraries can be called and used from C or C++.
       + Lots of legacy domain-specific code for science, physics and
         engineering are available in Fortran.
     + Problem:
       + Pretty old programming language.
       + No longer widely used.
       + Open source Fotran compilers such as GFortran (GNU Fortran)
         cannot match the performance of expensive proprietary
         compilers. 
       + Domain-specific.

   * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_%2528programming_language%2529][Julia Language]] (2012)
     + Value proposition: Syntax and convenience of Matlab and Fortran; almost the
       speed of C and C++; flexibility and convenience of Python. 

     + Features:

       + Dynamically typed with optional type anntations.

       + JIT - Just In Time compiler. The script code is compiled to
         machine code during runtime which increases the performance.

       + Built-in types convenient for numerical computing: arrays;
         matrices; multi-dimensional arrays.

       + Interoperability: 
         + Can use Python packages via CPython native interface C API. 
         + Can call C++, C or Fotran. 

       + No need to vectorized for-loops which decreases the
         performance in Matlab; Python + Numpy; Octave; Scilab and so
         on.

       + Support for functions and variables with unicode symbols such
         as greek letters: δ, ∇, ι ...

       + Multiple Dispatching

       + Lisp-like macros and metaprogramming features.

     + Disadvantages:
       + Slow startup time
       + Not suitable for low latency applications since Julia is
         garbage collected language.

     + Best use cases:
       + Machine learning
       + Scientific and numerical computing
       + Prototyping numerical algorithms and numerical methods

** Embedded, Real Time Systems and Safety-Critical System 

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)][Ada - programming language]] (1980)

  + Native code compilation, stronger static typing than C++; more
    memory-safe than C or C++; no gabarge-collector; pascal-based;
    built-in design-by-contract; concurrency in the language
    specification.

      fast visually by picking and placing user interface components in
      the same fashion as Visual Basic or Borland Delphi (now
      Embarcadero Delphi).
    + Features:
      + Based on Borland Delphi
      + Compilation to native code
      + Much Faster compile-time than C++
      + Can ship the application as a single executable which makes the
        deployment of Desktop GUI apps easier.
      + Build graphical user interfaces fast by dragging and dropping UI
        components like in Visual Basic 6 or Embarcadero (Old Borland)
        Delphi.
      + Static compilation with all dependencies.
      + Cross-platform - the same project can be recompiled with the
        IDE on Windows, Linux and Mac-OSX. 
      + Lots of built-in user interface components
      + Can reuse Delphi components
      + Lots of database connectivity components
      + Ability to call C-APIs, C-code and shared libraries. C++ code
        can be called with a C-interface (extern "C" ...)
    + Problems:
      + Some people may not like object-pascal syntax that is different
        from the C-like syntax.
      + Small community
      + Scattered documentation
      + Without proper discipline, the application can easily become an
        spaghetti as it is easier to mix the application code with the
        graphical user interface GUI code, although this shortcoming can
        be mitigated with MVC - Model View Controller.
    + Applications built with Lazarus IDE + Object Pascal

** C++ code as a component or as Library

  + *Shared Library with C-interface*
    + The C++ code can be turned into a shared library by manually
      writting a C-interface (lots of extern "C") that can be loaded
      from any programming language via foreign-function interface
      such as Python C-types, Java JNA or .NET / C# P-invoke.

  + *Shared Library with Programming Language Specific C native interface*
    + Many programming languages such as Python, Ruby or Java (JNI) are
      written in C or C++ and provide a native interface API where is
      possible to create native modules or libraries in C and load
      them as they were ordinary libraries. So, a C++ code can be
      turned into a Python library by compiling the code with its
      bindings or adapter code for Python native API. The drawback of
      this approach is that, it will be hard to reuse the library with
      other programming languages.

  + *Swig Wrapper Genrator*
    + The SWIG wrapper generator parses Swing interface files, C and
      C++ header files and then generates binding code for a native C
      interface of some specified programming language. So, SWIG can
      generate native Python, Ruby or Java and other languages native
      libraries.
** C++ with Embedded Scripting Languages

Embedded programming languages can make easier for non-technical or
non-programming users to extend, configure and customize applications
without any recompilation. They also allow end users to build add-ons,
extensions or plugins. This approach is widely used by games for
allowing non-programmers to create higher level logic, gameplay,
animation and mods. Some programming languages were designed
specifically to be embedded:

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl][TCL - Tool Command Language]] (1988)
    * Widely used as embedded scripting language in EDA - Electronic
      Design Automation Tool. This happens due to the language
      creator, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout][John Ousterhout]], initially develped TCL as an
      scripting extension language for EDA applications.

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)][Lua]] (Moon in Portuguese) Programming Language (1993)
    + Feature: Lua programming language is lightweight and minimal
      and avaialable as C-library easier to be embedded in a C or C++
      application.
    + Used in:
      + Games;
      + Nginx web server;
      + LuaTex;
      + MediaWiki (Wikipedia   wiki engine) - uses lua as a template engine
      + Nmap network scanner

  * [[https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html][Python]] (CPython implementation) (1991)
    * As Python is written in C, its runtime can be embedded in a C++
      application allowing it to be extended and customized by
      end-users and take advantage of users previous knowledge as
      Python is being used more and more for introducing
      programming. The disadvantage is that Python it is not so
      lightweight as language designed to be embedded in other
      applications and its native interface C-API is harder to use.

      * Note: The header-only library [[https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Pybind11]] makes easier to embed
        Python in C++ applications.

    * "mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language
      complying to (part of) the ISO standard. Its syntax is Ruby 1.9
      compatible. mruby can be linked and embedded within your
      application. We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and the
      interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can also
      compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
      compiler "mrbc". All those tools reside in the "bin"
      directory. "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte code
      in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under the "test"
      directory for an example."

    * "Chibi-Scheme [1] is a very small library intended for use as
      an extension and scripting language in C programs. In addition
      to support for lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself
      runs in an isolated heap allowing multiple VMs to run
      simultaneously in different OS threads."
